VERVE Ann Arbor Apartments,"I moved into Verve in August and have had an awesome experience! One particular employee, Casey V.,  has made my time nothing short of incredible.

Hidden Valley Club Apartments,"Pros:
My 5-star rating is for staff & maintenance Team (Lana, Nathan, Noah, Steve) & previous leasing staff (Rachel & Sydney). They are friendly and take care of things as best as they can within their control.

There is a dog park.

I am a current resident.

very good location! it has nearby access to bus stops 62,6,25, 67, briarwood mall/bus stops, Closer to freeway(I-94), some restaurants.

Cons:
In my opinion, apartment buildings are very old. Rent seems high if you are not sharing your place with others. They are working on renovating older apartments and increase the rent. There is a mandatory trash pickup fee just to take trash to the dumpster. There used to be a (club house- swimming pool & gym) which was burned down recently. residents can’t use it now. It will take a while to get it back. Please come & take a look around, talk to residents if possible and decide if you like to stay."
Hidden Valley Club Apartments,Jasmin and Lanna are awesome. Maintenance has improved and the grounds look better even though it's fall now and the leaves are falling. I recommend hidden valley because it's quiet and a nice place to stay. Prices make sense for the area. I'll more than likely renew my lease in the spring. I've seen bad reviews but to each is own.
Hidden Valley Club Apartments,"I’m not sure if I just had a different experience than others here, but mine was completely negative. I see a lot of 5-star reviews for this place, and honestly, I don’t know how. I’ll be completely transparent — this is a detailed, honest review based on my 1-year stay while working in Ann Arbor. I hope it helps you decide if this place is right for you. Keep in mind, this is my personal experience — others may have had better luck.

Apartment-

I chose the “renovated” unit mainly because it included an in-unit washer and dryer, which was important to me. However, don’t be fooled by the word “renovated.” All they did was install a new countertop and add the washer/dryer combo.
You can immediately tell the apartment is cheaply done — the paint is poorly applied, the blinds break easily, and the closet doors feel like they could fall apart with one touch.

When I moved in, the apartment wasn’t even clean. The stove was covered in thick, greasy residue that wouldn’t come off, and the floors were sticky. I had to mop multiple times before it felt livable. I genuinely don’t think they cleaned before turning the unit over.

Maintenance-

I had many issues, but two major ones stand out:

- Electrical problem:
The kitchen circuit shorted, causing three outlets (including the fridge) to stop working. I submitted a service request and maintenance came the next day. I told them it was probably a breaker issue, but they kept replacing outlets instead of checking the fuse box. They ended up wasting an entire day trying random fixes before finally sending someone the next day who confirmed — it was the breaker. Exactly what I said from the start.

- No heat during winter:
My heat went out during the coldest week of the season. The maintenance guy literally said, “I don’t know what I’m doing,” and left me with two small space heaters. I went five days without proper heat. Completely unacceptable and shows how unqualified their team is.

Insect Control -

If you like insects, you’ll feel right at home here. I lived on the basement floor, and during summer, hundreds of beetles gathered outside my bedroom window — and eventually started finding their way inside.
I tried calling the office… surprise — no one picked up (which became a theme). On top of that, there were spiders and worms throughout the apartment. It’s clear they don’t have any kind of pest control plan in place.

Leasing Office -

Easily the worst communication I’ve ever experienced from a management team. They never answer the phone — and I mean never.

One time, they decided to rekey the building doors and sent the new keys in envelopes. I never received mine. I tried calling over and over again, no response. I eventually had to go through Trowbridge just to get someone from Hidden Valley to talk to me. Their excuse was, “We were on a tour.” Either they’re severely understaffed or just don’t care.

This wasn’t a one-time thing — every time I needed to contact them, it was the same story. No one picks up, no one calls back.

Conclusion -

If you’re moving to Ann Arbor, please look elsewhere. You’ll save yourself a lot of stress and frustration. The only good thing about this place is the location — that’s it.

Don’t be fooled by management’s cookie-cutter replies or excuses to my post — they don’t reflect the real experience. Spend a little more for a better-managed and better-maintained apartment. It’ll be worth it in the long run."
Hidden Valley Club Apartments,"Did a tour with the Assistant Manager, Lanna Jones. She was very professional and informative.
The option for a discounted membership at
Crunch fitness was a real benefit as well. Due to a change in my career, I relocated to another state; but she definitely provided me with a wonderful experience."
Arbor Village Apartments,The move in was very seamless and Tori was a great help too with me being able to settle in at Ann Arbor. They had a maintenance guy show up on the same day I moved in also when I asked for some help about an appliance in my apartment. It's also a nice layout for the complex to take your dog out and have them do their business. I can tell I'll have a good time living here already.
Arbor Village Apartments,"I’ve lived at Ann Arbor Village twice with a gap in between, and it’s been one of the best places I’ve rented from in Ann Arbor. I moved out again simply because I left Ann Arbor for work. It’s a bit pricey for what you get, but all of Ann Arbor is unreasonably priced. The area is safe, quiet, convenient, and clean, plus maintenance is super responsive (literally next day responsive), as well as the leasing office staff. I had a bit of maintenance issues, but they were all resolved, which is sadly not common with apartments. They are slowly working on upgrades … new roofs, new windows, etc. Lots of maintenance people write you off in other complexes, but Arbor Village never did! I’m blanking on the maintenance guy’s names, but they have been with Arbor Village for both of my stays (so I’m guessing 3+ years), and that is rare … usually there is such high turn-over. Jasmine & Tori (who have also been there for both of my stays) are delightful, responsive, & kind. Some of my neighbors had been there for 10+ years, and again, that has to count for something. Overall, this is a great place to live, especially if you’re a single woman looking for a quiet, safe home!

If you live here, please take advantage of County Park, which is a less than 10 minute walk from these apartments—my favorite hidden gem that everyone seems to miss. You can also walk downtown, if you’re someone who is regularly active."
Arbor Village Apartments,"My husband and I would like to commend Tore for her great customer service in mid August. She handled a troublesome, difficult situation with great professionalism, poise and empathy arriving at a suitable and timely solution to the problem we presented her.
Our college age daughter was to move into an apartment at Hidden Valley Club. Prior to the move in date, she experienced several delays in communication with the leasing staff at HVC. She had several unanswered questions about the apartment, the fees, etc. We flew into town to assist her with the move, but on a very tight timeline. Many of you might recall the leasing office at Hidden Valley Club was destroyed in a fire. We were not aware of that event until we drove into the complex.
Around that same time, our daughter received a phone call informing her that Tore at Arbor Village Apts would be the point of contact for her lease signing.  With lots of unanswered questions, we headed to Arbor Village Apts in advance of our daughter who was driving into town a few hours later. Tore was immediately empathetic to the situation and offered an option for leasing an available apartment in Arbor Village: same # of bedrooms, reduced lease amount, etc. It all worked out so well!
Thanks to Tore for her professionalism, honesty and time she spent with us. We were able to move in that weekend as planned.
Karen and Stephen Elgin"
Arbor Village Apartments,"I moved into Arbor Village just a few days ago and ran into an issue with my dryer, it wouldn’t start for some reason, even though it’s a brand new machine. I was on a tight schedule that day and had a train to catch at 7pm, so I was honestly stressing out.

The maintenance team was amazing. Ethan and Toni came by multiple times to check on the issue, and after a couple of visits, they made a quick call: “We’ll just get you a new one.” And they really meant it within 10 minutes, the new dryer arrived, and they made sure everything was working perfectly before they left. Thanks to them, I was able to dry my clothes just in time for my trip.

I really appreciate how fast and efficient they were, and how they took it seriously right away. Big thanks to Ethan and Toni, hope this shoutout helps them get the recognition they deserve. Feeling much more confident about living here for the next year knowing the team is this responsive!"
Arbor Village Apartments,"Excellent landlords for the last year! Extremely quick maintenance, reasonable apartment pricing, and a very nice (to my standards atleast) apartment! Tore is always extremely helpful as well and the leasing office is quite cozy.

(Full disclosure that I wrote this review after going to a property pool party so the free tacos are definitely influencing me in some fashion here but I've had a genuinely great time renting from them!)"
The Legacy at Ann Arbor,"Choosing The Legacy at Ann Arbor as my apartment was honestly the best decision I’ve made. The rooms here are top quality, and the location couldn’t be better, it’s just a 5-minute walk to the UMich. Since it’s a new building, the air circulation and overall air quality are great. The furniture is modern and high-end, and all the appliances and daily-use products are from trusted international brands.👍

What I appreciate the most, though, is how kind and reliable the staff are. I want to give a special shout-out to the manager, Kelly — she’s helped me through so many little challenges of starting a new life here, always with so much patience and kindness. I really appreciate her professionalism and warmth. The front-desk team is also super friendly, attentive, and always willing to help."
The Legacy at Ann Arbor,"Living at Legacy Apartment Complex in Ann Arbor has been an absolutely awesome experience! Everything about this place is top-notch, and I love calling it home. The staff is super friendly and made the whole move-in process super easy. The apartments are gorgeous!! The amenities like the gym and pool are fantastic, and the community events add such a fun, welcoming touch. I’m so happy here and couldn’t ask for a better place to live!"
The Legacy at Ann Arbor,"My daughter lives and works at Legacy, and I visit her more than usual because I love the building so much.  We especially find Kelly and Denise to be extremely helpful and professional.  They are always available if/when my daughter has a question or concern.  This provides assurance to me, knowing that my daughter is in a safe and friendly environment.  I absolutely love the rooftop pool, the gym and basically all of the amenities that the building has to offer.  I rest easy knowing my daughter is living at the Legacy and the fact that the building is animal friendly is just another reason to love the Legacy."
The Legacy at Ann Arbor,I have really enjoyed living at the legacy. Management is amazing! They’re super helpful when I have any questions and they’re always in their office. Maintenance is super quick with repairs. They have fun events monthly and it’s a great opportunity to get to know other residents. The amenities are one of the best parts of living here! I totally recommend to anyone looking for housing.
The Legacy at Ann Arbor,"I’ve been living here for a few months and it’s a decent apartment. The amenities are nice and I especially like the study room and club room. The outdoor patios are well kept and let me get some sunlight. I'm interested to see how it will be kept during the winter season. I’m a big fan of the gym as well. There's a lot of equipment and I'm able to complete my usual workout.
For the apartment itself, there are some details that you can tell were a bit rushed. There are some dents in the walls and paint splatters on the floors. Nothing that is serious or takes away from it being a decent apartment. I had a hole about the size of an eraser on a pencil in my shower floor. I put in a work order and it went through fast. They patched it up and all is good now.
The elevators are constantly breaking down. I haven't heard of anyone being trapped in it, but I will go to use them and one or two are shut down for repairs.
All in all, it's a decent apartment. With it's location and amenities, the price for rent makes sense."
Woodland Mews,"Awesome location and this is what undoubtedly makes the high price. Awesome very friendly office staff and now also maintenance staff. This makes a big difference for me after living 16 years somewhere else in Ann Arbor. I really love my townhouse, but it is unfortunately quite old. All other places around have at least linoleum in the living room, but here we still have carpet everywhere (not healthy). The major issues are doors and windows which need to be replaced (not sealed, recurrence of bugs entering). The bathtubs would also benefit to be replaced with a more modern shower, or at least with new faucets. The air condition is not very efficient upstairs. But I appreciate a lot that I could have my own appliances. The highway is conveniently close by, but not too noisy so that I can enjoy sleeping with opened windows at night. We can walk and bike all around, garden and enjoy wild life !"
Woodland Mews,"I appreciate the prompt responses from the leasing office and maintenance team. A couple of minor issues I initially experienced were the noise from the upstairs unit (footsteps are very audible due to limited soundproofing, which is not the neighbors’ fault) and the black mold around the bathroom sink present since move-in, which we were informed we would need to remove ourselves.

Update (11/15/25): I would like to revise my review based on my recent experience with the leasing office. The maintenance concern mentioned above occurred last year. Since this summer, the current leasing office staff have been consistently attentive to residents’ concerns, and after seeing this review, they reached out to me and my roommate to address the issue. It has now been resolved. Their response time and follow-up have been reliable."
Woodland Mews,Nice ambience and peaceful are to stay. Well furnished and equipped Gym for common usage. Easy access for Meier and Busch around the apartment. Very close to Michigan University and football ground.
Woodland Mews,"We have lived at Woodland Mews for just over a year and have had a great experience. The maintenance team is super responsive & helps resolve our issues quickly. Can’t beat the location, either!"
Woodland Mews,"Avoid This Property at All Costs. I cannot recommend living here to anyone. After three years, I’ve seen and experienced enough to confidently say: save yourself the health risks, stress, and wasted money.

Multiple residents we met, during our time here, including those in both apartments and townhomes, have had to evacuate due to black mold. We personally dealt with multiple bursting pipes, malfunctioning appliances that were never upgraded, just repeatedly patched up, and continuous black residue in our water, which was never fixed (good luck to whoever is living there next!).

Want to speak to the GM or anyone in upper management? Good luck. They’re never available, always “in a meeting"" or ""not there,"" and consistently fail to respond to calls or emails. The front desk and maintenance staff are lovely and understanding, but unfortunately powerless when things go wrong.

The amenities have deteriorated significantly. No more snacks, no Starbucks coffee, no pool towels, etc. For the rent you pay, you deserve far better.

And if you’re hoping to get your security deposit back, think again. They’ll charge you a cleaning fee even if you’ve had the unit professionally cleaned, and expect to be billed an exorbitant amount for trivial things. It’s petty and exploitative.

They showed zero compassion to a military family dealing with an extraordinary circumstance on a return to duty date. If they won’t even support those who serve, do you really think they care about you?

This place is a money grab, plain and simple. Management is unresponsive, unaccountable, and unconcerned with residents’ well-being. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

Also for awareness - many of the positive reviews are written by people to win raffles and giveaways by the complex."
The Emerson Apartments,"I’ve had such a great experience at Emerson Apartments. The community is clean, modern, and well-maintained, but what really sets this place apart is the staff. Terrye Kraft is absolutely amazing—she goes above and beyond to make residents feel welcome and cared for. From the very first interaction, Terrye was professional, friendly, and genuinely helpful. She is quick to answer questions, attentive to details, and always makes sure any concerns are handled promptly.

It’s rare to find someone who truly makes apartment living feel stress-free, but Terrye does exactly that. Her kindness and dedication make this not just a place to live, but a place to feel at home.

I can’t recommend Emerson Apartments—and especially Terrye—highly enough!!"
The Emerson Apartments,"We recently toured this community and were absolutely blown away by the welcoming, red-carpet feel of the lobby. Every detail—from the spotless glass doors to the fresh-baked pastries waiting for residents and guests—has been thoughtfully curated, and it all comes without a premium price tag. Terrye, our leasing professional, was the epitome of hospitality: knowledgeable, responsive, and genuinely invested in helping us find our perfect home.

Beyond the stylish common areas, the neighborhood is wonderfully quiet yet just steps from shops, cafés, and groceries. As pet owners, we couldn’t be happier with the well-maintained dog areas and additional pet amenities. If you’re looking for a blend of comfort, convenience, and a touch of luxury without breaking the bank, this place checks every box. We can’t wait to move in!"
The Emerson Apartments,"I have worked with Hannah in the past finding an apartment to live and she is so easy to talk to, really listens to her clients wants and needs and is super reliable and communicative throughout the whole process! She is knowledgeable about the property and the area and is a joy to be around and work with! Definitely recommend requesting her to assist you in your apartment finding journey! She is the total package and will walk you through the journey and assure you end up in the perfect spot for you!!!"
The Emerson Apartments,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
If you’re hunting for a place to call home, stop scrolling and call Terrye at The Emerson—she is an absolute ROCKSTAR! 🤘

From the very first message, Terrye brought the perfect mix of knowledge, energy, and genuine excitement. When we changed our minds halfway through one floor plan, she didn’t miss a beat—she had a backup ready and guided us straight to the perfect layout we fell in love with. That kind of adaptability is rare, and she made it look effortless.

What really sets Terrye apart is how deeply she knows the area, the property, and the kind of community that thrives here. She’s not just showing apartments—she’s matching people with homes.

Through the entire process—touring, applications, paperwork—she was bubbly, friendly, and laser-focused on making sure we had everything we needed.

And here’s the best part: if she didn’t know an answer, she found it. Fast. No runaround, no fluff—just results. That’s the kind of professionalism you don’t see every day.

We came looking for a place to live, but from the moment we pulled into the drive, Terrye had us sold. She’s the real deal, and The Emerson is lucky to have her."
The Emerson Apartments,"Updated: Originally thought this was a great place but after they got my application they ghosted me. to an extent I understand because I had a dispute (not even for late rent or anything). I let the rep TK know this was being taken to district court by me AND disputed as they had no grounds. I heard nothing back it's been  a week. Very unprofessional. I decided to go with another apartment but the least they could've done was let me know it was a no as I paid over $100 for the application and did my due diligence with a cosigner.

Absolutely beautiful place. I was thoroughly impressed it checked all the boxes to me. I was shown around by Terrye Kraft  who was incredibly kind and helpful. I told her mid tour ""I'm giving  you and this place 5 stars"". She was easy to talk to, very open, and answered every question I had. :D I'm choosing between this place and another but I think this place won for me!"
Pine Valley Apartment Homes,"I have had a very negative experience living at Pine Valley for almost 4 years, and I don’t recommend it to anyone. Their infrastructure, grounds, and buildings are kept in poor condition, and their maintenance staff is awful. This has resulted in numerous problems for me over the years, one of which (my car being flooded in my assigned parked space in their parking lot) cost me tens of thousands of dollars.

The storm drains at my complex were blocked, causing the parking lot to flood during a summer storm (see photo). My car was totaled and I had to buy a new one. After lots of arguing with the landlords, they ultimately did nothing at all. A month or two later, the parking lot flooded a second time. I was home and moved my car, so no damage, and they finally decided to have the storm drain professionally snaked. They refused to give me a new parking spot and assured me it was fine. Then, a month later a THIRD PARKING LOT FLOOD happened in the middle of the night; I woke up and found my car in 14 inches of standing water. Had to take it in for service, it ended up being okay (higher clearance on my new car), but the check-up cost me. After months of stress, emails, not being able to get to work, etc and tens of thousands of dollars in damages due to their bad infrastructure, Pine Valley ultimately gave me $0 in compensation.

The buildings are in poor shape in general, and maintenance is shoddy. I have been dealing with ants coming in through vents and windows/cracks in the foundation throughout my 4 years here, including carpenter ants which live in rotting wood (see photo). Maintenance is a joke—I once had them unclog my shower drain (regular need due to the old narrow pipes), and they LEFT all the gray sludge from the pipes sitting in my tub and sprayed around my bathroom where my cat could get into it (see photo). Many of the “repairs” they’ve done have been useless – they had to fix the door closer on the door leading into my apartment, and it looked like it was done by a 4 year old with a screwdriver (see photo; it obviously broke again a few days later). They also had to replace electrical breakers, and they tore up my drywall in the process and just left giant holes in the wall (see photo); I emailed them about the issue, and they simply never responded. They also illegally issue blanket notices of entry for “some time over these 5 days” (see photo for example), so you actually have no idea when contractors, inspectors, etc are going to be coming into your home.

They have a new resident manager every 6-12 months (high turnover never a good sign...) so you’re constantly dealing with someone new who doesn’t know what’s going on. Also, although this isn’t their fault, they are located in the part of Ann Arbor that has the most frequent and longest lasting DTE power outages, so if you live here you have to be prepared for multi-day stretches without power during winter storms.

I could honestly keep sharing details and photos of even more bad experiences, but I think the image is clear. Rent somewhere else. I’m looking forward to moving elsewhere this summer."
Pine Valley Apartment Homes,"I lived here for all my college years in umich and I love here so much. I believe if I was successfully admitted to the master school in umich, I would choose to stay here for more time.

The apartment is clean, big and quiet. There are enough parking lots so even when my friends came and visited me, they can always find somewhere to park .

Officers and maintenance team are friendly and always willing to help. More than once I locked myself outside my apartment during midnight but they are never impatient to me and always came quickly to help me open the door. When my grinder is broken because of my improper operation, they responded to my request timely and find someone who can help me immediately.

Especially, Shannon is so great! She always make me feel welcomed and make everything organized. I definitely will miss her >"
Pine Valley Apartment Homes,"I lived at Pine Valley apartments for three years for school. The unit itself is great for its size and price, especially in Ann Arbor. Most of my maintenance requests were addressed right away. Pine Valley was very accommodating during my move and worked out a flexible move out timeline for me which was really helpful. Overall, I was happy to call it home!"
Pine Valley Apartment Homes,"I was a resident at Pine Valley Apartments from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, they had a pretty nice set of office staff. They hosted an annual ""resident appreciation week"" where they offered free food and raffles for prizes. My roommate and I won a 50in 4K TV, which was great. However, these resident appreciation weeks halted around 2022 for unknown reasons. While living at Pine Valley got off to a great start, it gradually worsened each year. The turnover for office and maintenance staff was incredibly high. I counted about 6 residential managers between 2019 and 2023, all of whom left abruptly. In 2023, they hired a new manager named Kelly. She seemed fine at first, but I quickly changed my mind. I had intended to vacate my apartment but had to cancel this plan at the last second because my plans fell through. Kelly was angry that I cancelled. So she lied, saying the apartment had already been leased to someone else. She attempted to illegally evict my roommate and me from our home, threatening to send lawyers and police to force us out of the apartment. I had never encountered someone so cold before.

Despite Kelly's bosses knowing what she had done, they did not fire her. Kelly continued her behavior, but it was now directed at all residents. Pine Valley had been in non-compliance with the city of Ann Arbor for nearly a year, and Kelly decided to hang signs on the buildings threatening to pass the city fines Pine Valley received onto the residents if they refused to allow city inspectors or maintenance personnel to enter their homes. My apartment, in particular, needed its tub reglazed (something many other apartments also needed). However, my bathtub was chipped and in need of reglazing the day I arrived in my apartment in 2019.

They had ample opportunities to address these problems each time there was resident turnover, for instance, they could have reglazed my tub before I moved in. Therefore, it's preposterous for Pine Valley and Kelly to attempt shifting the blame and consequences of non-compliance onto the residents. Many of the reasons for the non-compliance were due to issues that had been neglected for years. Pine Valley has no one to blame but themselves for their non-compliance. And yes, this means they have to accept the consequences of their greed and neglect. Perhaps they could hang signs on the buildings that say ""We are sorry for neglecting these buildings for many years and not fixing things before you moved in. We want to change that now, so please help us do that."" Rather, this is how they acted in a nutshell: ""Let us fix your homes now that the city inspectors are onto us. If you don't let us in now, we will fine you. How dare you disrespect us."" Hypocrisy at its finest.

I could touch on many other issues, such as how the pool wasn't being cared for anymore as it was filthy most of the time. Conveniently, they would close the pool when the city inspectors came, then reopen it when they left. Or I could mention how the apartment would heat up very easily and it was usually very humid and stuffy inside even with the A/C on or windows open. They did not consider spraying for wasp nests or yellow jacket nests on the buildings or by the pool, so there were a ton of wasps and yellow jackets near the pool or near our balcony. It's common courtesy to monitor wasp/yellow jacket nests to protect residents from being stung. I could never fully enjoy sitting on my balcony with all the wasps flying around. We even had wasps get inside, likely through a crack in our sliding door.

The only positives I can provide are: the rent is somewhat affordable compared to other places in Ann Arbor, the nearby neighborhood is nice, they offer month-to-month leases, and I liked how much closet space we had. However, personally, these positives do not compensate for the major issues I witnessed.

All in all, I do not recommend living at Pine Valley. Unless they learn to treat residents with as much respect as they demand, I don't foresee any improvement at Pine Valley."
Pine Valley Apartment Homes,"Be careful when moving here. Several of my friends who are students live here. I decided to check them out for rental. On two different occasions  two different staff managers were rude. I thought maybe they are having a bad day or they are not being treated  well themselves.  These apartments looked  good on the outside however Pine Valley  controls the heat.  It is extremely hot or cold in the winters. After studying  at my friends apartment for 3 days I now  know the boilers go out often.   It was cold for an extended  time in his apartment while they found some company who could fix the problem.  They never notified  him so we could  go to hotel they acted like this was not an issue,  They also turn the water off to  fix  water issues and broken pipes often.  Underneath  the painted walls  is lead paint.  I am from India, while in their office they  acted like they had a problem  with my skin color so  I  chose not to move here I will stay in U of M dorms. If I could give  them a zero for customer service I would . They have high turnover on staffing"
The Villas at Main Street,"Decent complex
The staff were all super friendly and the complex is beautiful. I didn't get a tour of the apartments but the clubhouse is nice and well maintained. There's a small gym in the clubhouse towards the front of the complex. There's also a little lounge area.
The pool is really nice however it was pretty dirty. I understand some debris from wind and weather but it looks as if it hasn't been cleaned in a few days.
Also, there were a lot of bees around the pool so that was very bothersome but I understand it's unavoidable sometimes.
There aren't any indoor pools/spas which is definitely disappointing since the summer season is ending soon.
The large bathroom stall doesn't lock but there are showers you can access in the women's locker room.
Personally, for an apartment claiming to be luxury, I don't agree with that title. I feel like it's decent and the staff are nice."
The Villas at Main Street,"I have lived at Villas on Main Street for over a year and a half, and overall the experience was less than satisfactory. The location proved to be convenient, and the manager was very good at pointing the finger at owners of this apartment complex.
The maintenance staff are great but they have no say in recommendations for old inefficient equipment to be replaced. So the turnover of maintenance staff is high, because they don’t want to deal with the stress of tenants and the stress management puts on them to do repairs with limitations.

The manager of this establishment must get a great bonus every month from the owners to keep their cost down, by not replacing aging and inefficient appliances and equipment.
However, it's essential to note that the apartments showed signs of aging interior and exterior, despite some attempts at renovation. Issues like a rusty dishwasher and electric stove, sticky folding doors, poor window and door insulation, and a worn-out tub with wall tiles improperly installed were regular occurrences. Also not functioning bike racks, many pot holes throughout the community, not enough parking garages and parking line spaces have not been repainted for years, my apartment bedroom ceiling has reoccurring water leaks, poorly designed dog park. I must add due to hot weather this year, we had bee’s coming in through inside apartment vents
The maintenance team was responsive, but it became quite unpleasant to deal with the frequent need to request services due to the apartment's aging condition.

I would strongly recommend conducting a detailed move-in inspection and documenting with pictures any pre-existing borderline misfunctions or worn-out areas to avoid disputes with the management. Otherwise, they might attribute such issues as ""damages"" and request payment for replacements.

It’s definitely not a “LUXURY” apartment community, except for the price. While the place isn’t perfect, and due to my age and financial situation it is serving its purpose for now."
The Villas at Main Street,"I've lived at Villas at Mainstreet for 6 years - and love the community. Some units are better than others (layout, upgrades, location within the community, etc.) - but most of that is subjective. I've lived in 2 different units and would highly recommend it here. The location is amazing - Bush's grocery is like a minute away, 94 is like 3 minutes away, UMich campus is less than 5 minutes away. It's just a great location. The staff is really helpful and responsive. I don't really have anything bad to say about it. If I HAD to pick something that could be improved - I'd say maybe the package room gets a little crazy sometimes. But they only have so many lockers so with the number of people who live here, that's bound to happen. The pool could be a little bigger also (I've never once used it in 6 years - but maybe if it was bigger and there was a hot tub or sauna I would). Also, it's a bit pricy (but that's what you get in Ann Arbor)."
The Villas at Main Street,"***Trash and recycling area is a long standing public safety and sanitation hazard (that is my opinion, but please be your own judge and look at the photos). This situation has been going on since early June 2025 until today (Aug 27, 2025), and was first reported on June 10th. Management has proven unwilling/unable to take meaningful or sustainable action in resolving these issues, they consider these hazards to just be ""unsightly"". This area is less than 100 feet from my building and 20 feet from where I park.

The 4 small recycling dumpsters absolutely overflow into the road every weekend and management is not willing to schedule additional pickups on the weekend. The trash compactor area is regularly blocked with bulk items, furniture, broken appliances (placed in plain sight by the maintenance team), and piles of loose torn open trash bags.

This is a large community and to think that 4 small recycle dumpsters with only Mon/Wed/Fri pickups would be sufficient is beyond insanity. The weekend is peak demand and neither recycling nor trash are picked up.

***Everything else is true about the heating/cooling and lack of insulation being absolutely sub-par and incapable of keeping a livable temperature. I was forced to put of tons of heavy/insulated curtains on every window in order to somewhat improve the situation.

***Upon move-in, our washer and stove were beyond repair, non-functional, and absolutely filthy. The community manager (Samantha) claimed that the issues were ""cosmetic"" (without looking at them, and at her own admission, without maintenance knowledge) and tried to say no to replacing them. This was after maintenance came out multiple times over several weeks to attempt to service these trashy old appliances.

0 stars, 0 stars, 0 stars

Sep 4 update: I'll continue to add time/date stamped photos to show how disingenuous Mgmt's response was. I have been calling/submitting maintenance/emailing property mgmt directly for 3+ months now...if they want to talk they know my email, if they want to find a partial solution, they simply need to schedule recycling pickup on Sunday."
The Villas at Main Street,"The Assistant Community Manager, Jackson, has been the most unprofessional and arrogant person I’ve encountered in the U.S. I would strongly caution anyone dealing with him.
1.	They charged me an extra insurance fee for several months even though I had already provided proof of my own insurance via email. Only later did I learn (without any notification) that they required a separate “system submission.” No follow-up, no reminder, just months of unnecessary charges.
2.	The maintenance team originally told us that the balcony light could not be turned off due to “government regulations.” My roommate suffered for months because the bright light was directly outside his bedroom. Only after we pressed further did they admit it was actually their mistake.

Worst of all was Jackson’s attitude. Instead of taking responsibility, he was dismissive, arrogant, and tried to shift all the blame back to us. When we tried to discuss the issues, he told us to leave his office and refused to continue the conversation. His behavior came across as extremely disrespectful, and even discriminatory.

When you leave negative views, they rely ‘we can have an open conversation’ but the truth is , it’s just a show. They even don’t reply the email

I rarely leave reviews, but this was such an awful experience that I feel compelled to warn others."
Uptown Ann Arbor,"I have been living at Uptown Ann Arbor for a year, and I absolutely love it here! The community is beautiful, peaceful, and very well maintained. The apartments are modern and comfortable, making it truly feel like home.

What makes the experience even better is the amazing leasing office team. Tyler and Tamara have always been kind, helpful, and professional. They are attentive to residents’ needs and always provide outstanding service.

I highly recommend Uptown Ann Arbor to anyone looking for a great place to live with a supportive and friendly staff."
Uptown Ann Arbor,"I’ve had a wonderful experience at Uptown Ann Arbor Apartments thanks to the outstanding work of Tyler (Property Manager) and Tamara (Assistant Manager). They are always professional, friendly, and go above and beyond to make sure everything runs smoothly. Their dedication and attention to detail truly make Uptown a great place to live. Thank you both for your excellent service!"
Uptown Ann Arbor,"Tamara at Uptown Apartments Ann Arbor is AMAZING!!  Her knowledge and straightforwardness is what I APPRECIATE about Tamara SO MUCH!  She is NOT pushy with selling units.  But she leaves you with so much information and honesty that you leave WANTING to become a resident.  Every unit shown to us was STUNNING!   Unfortunately, the person who styled the units we saw has retired. But I have high hopes that their current interior designer will bring similar delightfulness in decor.

If ever you are interested in renting spaces, Uptown Ann Arbor is the place to be; Tamara is THE person to work with!!"
Uptown Ann Arbor,"I have lived at Uptown for about four years in two different units. It has been a great experience. Tyler and Tamara are friendly, approachable, and fast to respond to communication. From the start Tyler has been so helpful, and in particular when we wanted to move into a larger unit, he offered a showing and facilitated a move for us quickly and smoothly. We were also hoping for a garage in our building, and he went above and beyond to make that happen. Tamara has responded to my questions and technical issues with patience and perseverance. The maintenance team also deserves a shout out-they are responsive, helpful, and kind! The community is quiet, friendly, and a really nice place to live."
Uptown Ann Arbor,"I moved into Uptown Ann Arbor 6 months ago, and I really enjoy living here. While settling In Ann Arbor, Tyler (Property Manager) and Tamara (Assistant Manager) were fantastic in supporting me. The property is well managed and the apartments are well designed and in good condition. The location is a perfect. It is a great mixture of living in a quiet place, while having shops (meijers, target, etc).  and restaurants in close proximity"
Hideaway Apartments Ann Arbor,Very friendly and informative staff
Valley Ranch Apartments,"Maintenance here feels like an endless cycle of band-aid fixes rather than real repairs which just drags out the issue.  My AC unit was broken for a month this summer during the hottest heatwaves (100F+) and despite multiple visits from maintenance it took them over a month to fix.  I felt no sense of urgency or accountability from management.  Now, hundreds of bees swarm my hallways daily, and despite multiple calls from me and a neighbor, the issue remains unaddressed and the hallways are littered with dead bees.  This has turned our shared space into an anxiety inducing buzzard hazard.  On top of that, a neighbor's broken-down junk car has sat in the lot for over seven months, dragging down curb appeal and perceived value of the complex.

Despite multiple issues, rent goes up by at least $100 each year even if you're a good tenant and they won't even negotiate."
Valley Ranch Apartments,"Update (10/16):
It took a month, but the washer and dryer issue has finally been resolved. However, the ""dusty"" A/C vents I previously complained about turned out to be more than just dust. They are full of mold. Every single vent. I've been scrubbing them with a Borax solution for over an hour, but the small crevices are impossible to clean.

-----

The apartment is missing various hardware. The washer smells of mildew/mold and left a residue on the mattress protector I purchased this morning. The previous tenant's belongings were not fully removed. The kitchen cabinets were left unrepaired. The bathroom tub has peeling paint and is dirty. The bathroom sink is also dirty and clogged.

These issues are especially frustrating, given that I was originally told I couldn't move in on my chosen date due to renovations and cleaning. My move-in date was pushed back by two weeks. During the first week of that delay, I was informed that they still wouldn't be able to complete the upgrade renovations unless I delayed my move-in by an additional two to three weeks.

There was also confusion regarding the submission of my SSN and driver's license. I was told to email them, which I did, but was later informed that they never received it due to computer issues, despite having received another email in the same email chain. Additionally, a different staff member at the leasing office told me I wasn't required to send that information via email in the first place.

Maintenance added an Affresh cleaner to the washer, so hopefully that resolves the mildew smell. They also confirmed that it smelled bad.

Edit: The Affresh did nothing.

-----

Side note: Randy and Tori, the maintenance guys, have been friendly and quick with their repairs. I'd give them a 5/5 if there were a separate review just for them."
Valley Ranch Apartments,"We just moved into Valley Ranch Apartments, and so far, we’re really happy with our decision! The community is clean, quiet, and feels very safe. The staff has been helpful and welcoming throughout the move-in process. Maintenance responded quickly to our requests, and everything was handled smoothly. The apartment itself is spacious and well-maintained, with a nice layout and modern amenities. Looking forward to making this place home! Thanks."
Valley Ranch Apartments,"Very nice and spacious apartments, clean and quiet location, and close to University of Michigan campus. It was a great experience working with our leasing consultant Jasmine, who arranged the tours for the apartments and helped us finalize the apartment we will be moving into soon. She was very patient and courteous. Highly recommended!"
Valley Ranch Apartments,"Jasmine has been great the whole move in process. As new renters, we’ve had lots of questions, and she’s been so quick to answer them. She even had the cleaners come back out on our move in date to better clean the space, which we very much appreciated."
Woodbury Gardens Apartments & Townhomes,"The worst managment you can think of.
Although they hold a valuable place with very nice people coming to live there, the only thing the managment cares about is monrey and follow thier rules.
We got endless emails from the managment that things in the backyard must be collected back home (these things belong to babies playing outside...) and that a violation of the rules is against the place expected behavior 🤷
The best part comes when you leave the place! We gave a notice of 40 days to the managment that we are not renewing the rental. It was not enough, and they have been charging us for 20 days rental, as the RULE says it has to be 60 days.
Needless to say that our place was rented to others within a week after we left, but.... a rule is a rule in Woodbury, and money to the managment ia above all other things 🤑🤑
Better not to do business with people who dont care much about you but more about your wallet"
Woodbury Gardens Apartments & Townhomes,"Lived here from December 2020 to June 2023.

Some pros and cons from my experience:


1. Well maintained: It is not a brand new apartment complex, but it is pretty well taken after, so never had any major issues, both in my unit and in general. They also undergo a few updates now and then.
2. Just the right distance from school: It took me just over 20 minutes to get to Ross on foot one way, which is not that terrible in my opinion. There are also buses for downtown on both Industrial and Packard sides. I liked that I wasn't right by the school with a whole lot of noise. I didn't take advantage of the free shuttle that much because the schedule didn't fit me very well.
3. Zipcars: I do not own a car, but  there are a couple of Zipcars by the clubhouse, which was a huge plus for me. Was one of the deciding factors in making me live here.
4. Staff: Both the managing staff in the clubhouse and the maintenance crew are generally nice. Both move in and move out were very smooth.


1. Rent: Now there are other newer places with much higher rent in town, but I would not describe this place as affordable.   I locked in really low rent during Covid, but otherwise probably wouldn't have been able to afford this place.
2. Occasional power outages: Yes there are power outages due to storms, etc., but there were also a couple of isolated power outage incidents in my building, possibly due to the wildlife messing with the equipment or it being outdated.

These are all I can think of now, but will keep updating if something comes to mind."
Woodbury Gardens Apartments & Townhomes,"* This is an honest, well-deserved review and we were not asked by anyone to write this. *

We searched and contacted countless apartments in Ann Arbor before our move there (first time living in AA and MI as we are not from there). We ended up renting with WGA for a year (lived at the 1960 building, which is by South Industrial Highway) and we cannot recommend Woodbury Gardens enough. From the very beginning, they were on top of things.

We rented a more outdated, pet friendly unit (all the appliance were old but they were in excellent working condition) and we were happy with it. If you prefer to pay more, they also offer renovated units. The unit was spacious and had lots of natural light. Maintenance requests (e.g., closet doors popping out, bathtub glazing, etc.) were always answered promptly. Management and staff are very responsive and overall, pretty solid human beings!

The neighbourhood complex is very well maintained (seriously, I’ve never seen more perfect grass). They also just redid the parking lots last month. There is a dog park (very clean), tennis courts, a basketball court, playground and the Club House has lounge areas, office spaces, kitchens, a gym, an outdoor pool, BBQ spaces, free wifi, coffee/tea/snacks etc. for UM football games, they have tailgating events that serve free grub! The street parking usually gets jam-packed by folks going to the football games, but is otherwise very open and accessible (there’s plenty of parking behind your specific building anyway).

Besides all this, we loved that groceries stores, liquor stores, CVS, gas stations, highway, Target, Whole Foods, etc were all nearby. Drives to downtown often took 6-10 minutes depending on traffic. We never had issues with excess noise (or any noise at all to be honest).

We will surely miss living in such a beautiful, green space. Thank you WGA for making our first stay in AA / Michigan so wonderful!"
Woodbury Gardens Apartments & Townhomes,"It's a great place to live, on the expensive side, but the overall quality and amenities make it worth. I share a 2 bedroom unit with 3 friends to save $, and the fact we haven't had any structural breakdowns is probably impressive. Management is friendly and helpful. The clubhouse with a common area, game room, pool, and complimentary light breakfast is a nice bonus. The apt complex is walking distance to a bowling alley, CVS, and Salvation Army, and is close to many other shops and small businesses."
Woodbury Gardens Apartments & Townhomes,"I have been leaving at Woodbury Gardens since a month now, and have been enjoying the experience so far.

When we moved in, the house was quite clean (although a bit, old) but some of the appliances were not working well. However, the maintenance is good. We had to raise several service requests, and they were all resolved within a few days. And, they have some people on the team, like Eric, who go a long way to ensure that residents are comfortable. A good maintenance team is crucial for an apartment community, and I think that is the strength of Woodbury that it should maintain.

Also, I love the amenities they have - like the conference rooms, printers, and massage chairs."
Avant Apartments,"This apartment community is genuinely a great place to live. The property is always clean, quiet, and well taken care of, and the location couldn’t be better. What truly sets this place apart is the management team—they’re consistently friendly, responsive, and professional. Andrew, the general manager, deserves special recognition for always being attentive and going the extra mile.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great home."
Avant Apartments,I toured this property and I will say I loved it. From the location and all the easy access to shopping and having the UofM football stadium down the street. I feel it is situated in the perfect spot in Ann Arbor if you are looking to raise a family or a single person looking for a home with a lot of outlets near by. The living spaces inside of the units are very spacious and give a warm comforting feeling. The staff in office is amazing from answering questions to making you feel at home when you visit. All around great community and great staff. Highly recommend this community.
Avant Apartments,"Update (after almost 2 months): I can honestly say I’m still so happy here! The community continues to feel warm and welcoming, and the maintenance team has been wonderful. Logan always shows up the same day for any requests — he’s friendly, professional, and genuinely cares about keeping things running smoothly. We just had our first snow, and everything was taken care of right away — walkways cleared, paths salted, even my front doorway spotless! It’s such a relief to live somewhere so well-maintained and thoughtfully managed. Avant truly remains a great place to call home.

Original Review:
I recently relocated from New York to Michigan, and the Avant team made the entire process seamless. From my very first virtual tour to move-in day, Rebecca, Nick, and Andrew went above and beyond. They answered every one of my (many!) questions about the location, schools, and community, and even recommended the movers I ended up using — who were excellent.

What really stood out to me was how friendly, responsive, and genuinely helpful they were every step of the way. Moving across states is stressful, but they made it smooth, easy, and even exciting. I felt welcomed before I even arrived.

The property itself is fantastic, the community feels kind and inviting, and my apartment is exactly what I was looking for — I absolutely love it. Thank you, Avant team, for taking so much of the stress out of moving and helping me find a true home!"
Avant Apartments,"My boyfriend and I were deciding between a couple of apartments and decided to move in to Avant a couple months ago. Moving was seamless, the leasing office is one of the kindest and most knowledgeable I have seen (shout out to Nick and Andrew).

The apartments are beautiful, well insulated, parking is readily available and the neighborhood is always kept clean.

I would recommend this complex to anyone!"
Avant Apartments,"We have loved living here! The staff and our neighbors have been so friendly, and are always willing to help. Our dog also loves the dog park! It’s so nice to have a place for her to run off some energy :) I highly recommend if you’re a young professional looking for a place to call home!"
Packard Row Apartments,"Impressed with Packard Row! Brand new, luxury apartments in a great South Ann Arbor neighborhood . Love the modern finishes and great amenities like the fitness center and clubhouse. The location is perfect, with easy access to shopping, dining, and the university. A wonderful and sustainable place to call home!"
AVIA Lofts on Victors Way,"I have called several times and am unable to get ahold of anyone. I still don’t have a status update on my application and I need to move immediately. It was strange that I had to link my bank account to the application and contact third party “guarantors” — I’ve never heard of such a thing. The guy showing me the apartment was friendly and responsive, but overall the process seemed weird, especially since very few people appear to be renting here. Still definitely want the apartment, but really need some clarity and straight answers. Thanks."
AVIA Lofts on Victors Way,"I just moved in and have already had major problems here. It took me a month to get my application submitted, and it took me contacting the office 6 TIMES to get any response to help me figure it out. I have lived here for two weeks and somehow only just signed my lease today, and the whole process has been a nightmare. I have had numerous calls with the leasing office and had to go there in person 3 times to get this figured out. We were told to move in Labor Day and then told we couldn't because it was a holiday. We complained and were thankfully allowed to move in on Labor Day,  because we had already arranged our schedules so we would be free that day. They didn't tell us until a week before moving in that the apartment would be furnished, which threw a wrench in both of our plans. The furniture is fine, but sterile enough that I feel like I live in a bank waiting room. The lease I signed today said that if you pay the first month of rent late, they will charge you the late fee ($100) and accelerate all future payments without notice, so if you're really short on funds, don't come here. It also said that if your car isn't functioning, it is therefore in the parking lot illegally and will be towed at your own expense. So if your car breaks down, you are not allowed to keep it in the place you live, and if you already can't afford to get it fixed, you have to pay for it to get towed too. The lease also said they could renovate things without notice, so long as it does not ""substantially"" raise utility prices. It did not clarify what ""substantially"" meant. The apartments are clean and in good shape, there is a gym in my building, the complex seems nice and safe, and I'm close to downtown. However, I would not have signed to live here if I had other options. But I'm a student at UMich and needed to have a place locked down before the semester started, so here I am.

Edit: I wrote the original review when I was really frustrated and gave 1 star, and while I still agree with the things I said I’ve moved it up to 3 stars. I’ve lived here a few months now and things have been pretty good. I’m very comfortable and the apartment is nice overall. I have plenty of space and the amenities are nice. Deliveries are often left outside the building and and stay there for a few days without being stolen. The wifi for me is pretty good but in other parts of the building it is very slow, so I think it just depends on where you are for that. The walls are pretty thin and sound travels easily and the windows aren’t super well insulated so I plan on getting a winterizing kit for them soon. One recommendation if you move in is to not put your rent on autopay because sometimes the amount is incorrect. Overall I think the place is alright but the organization in admin is not good. Seems like they’re understaffed."
AVIA Lofts on Victors Way,"Wanted to echo some of the concerns other commenters have pointed out. The apartment might have improved lately, but this is current as of early august late July. I haven't had any problems with the mailbox delivery, but the included 50 dollar internet is terrible. There was a period of time we had no maintenance guy because the maintenance guy was tasked with dealing with all residents and the company was too stingy to hire him a single assistant, poor guy. The property manager seldom picks up phone calls or responds to emails. There's been a night without internet, a different night without hot water, and the halls are dirty. Like the other reviewer John K, can't wait to move out. Don't usually post reviews but just wanted to help you all with this information in case it's relevant to you.
I see many 5 star reviews so I'm guessing in the past this apartment was much better. Maybe that means there is still hope!"
AVIA Lofts on Victors Way,"The woman with red hair in the office is arrogant and rude. You may want to consider having someone with a more positive attitude and better customer service skills. Acting like I was a bother, is unacceptable for someone running a business."
AVIA Lofts on Victors Way,"Worst experience I've ever had. They processed my application with a $53 application fee and declined it for no reason. Kristi told me that I should have no trouble getting my application accepted once I showed her my deposit and credit score. But it turns out differently. They rejected my application and I could not get in touch with them for a long period. I had to drive to their office every time, they usually weren't there, and they didn't return my calls. They misrepresented the application process, the acceptance rate, and the availability of the property, claiming to hold it for me but ultimately booking it for someone else. Kristi called me a few months later to let me know that the apartment they claimed they would hold for me was already taken up by someone else and that they had another one available, but it was significantly more expensive. She added that she would follow up with me for further details. However, since then, I haven't gotten a call.  Also, they did not refund my application fee either."
City Place Ann Arbor,"I lived at City Place for 2 years and had a pretty good experience. The leasing office got better after it switched over (yay), and the maintenance team was consistently helpful and accommodating. The rooms and units are very spacious, it’s definitely a steal for the price & for college housing."
City Place Ann Arbor,"Living at City Place has been a great experience! The rooms are very clean, located in a good, convenient area that is very close to campus. City Place also offers a lot of space and your own bathroom for a very good price compared to other places! I did run into a few issues here and there, but maintenance was always quick to respond and got things taken care of efficiently and fast. City Place has been a comfortable and enjoyable place to live in, and I would definitely recommend it to others looking for college housing. My friends and I have already signed to re-lease for next year!"
City Place Ann Arbor,"I have lived at city place for 3 years and genuinely think that it is one of the best options for student housing on campus. The rooms are much more spacious than other buildings and most layouts have an on-suite which is really nice. Management is really responsive and maintenance requests tend be handled in less than a week. Overall, I have had a great experience living here and would definitely recommend. It really can't get much better than City Place!"
City Place Ann Arbor,I will start by saying I love love love city place!! I think it is the perfect place for any university of Michigan student. We have a friend group of six girls living here (with all extremely different majors) and this location caters to all of us. It’s relatively close to any class you’d have on campus/close to bus stops. The house itself is very nice and modern. Having your own room and bathroom is the best. While I have had quite a few issues with my room/bathroom the maintenance staff did eventually get it fixed. I will include some photos of my room before I moved in. It’s an incredible space and lovely place to live!!
City Place Ann Arbor,"I’ve really enjoyed living in this townhouse. The location is one of the biggest perks — it’s super close to my classes. The townhouse itself is spacious, comfortable, and has a really welcoming feel that made it easy to settle in and call it home. I’ve genuinely loved my time here with my roommates and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place that’s both convenient and enjoyable to live in."
Hoover + Greene,"I’ve lived at H&G for a little under 18mos, and have really enjoyed my experience. The building itself is nice and has a range of good amenities (pretty decent apartment gym, nice pool deck and grill area, great common room space that can be reserved).

The best part of H&G have been the various staff members I’ve interacted with. Kalie from the front office is always attentive and easy to work with. Austin, the service manager, is fantastic. I’ve had a number of service requests submitted where he or Gage have show up within a few hours to make the fix. Compared to other places I’ve lived, dad and away the best service experience I’ve had.

Would recommend H&G to anyone moving to Ann Arbor and looking for apartment-style living."
Hoover + Greene,"I’ve had a great experience living at this apartment community. The management team is responsive and friendly, always quick to address any maintenance requests or questions. The building is clean, quiet, and well-maintained, with modern amenities and a convenient location close to shops, restaurants, and public transportation. I also really appreciate the sense of safety and the respectful atmosphere among neighbors. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a comfortable and hassle-free place to live!"
Hoover + Greene,"We moved into Hoover and Greene this fall, and it has been a great experience! Brittany in the office  has been so responsive and helpful with every question and detail. The complex is clean and quiet.  Any maintenance requests are handled quickly. Great place!"
Hoover + Greene,"I’ve been in this retail space since 2023, and every single person who visits—whether they come into our studio or walk through the lobby—can’t help but stop and admire how beautiful, clean, and thoughtfully decorated this building is. The attention to detail is visible in every corner!

The management, staff, and maintenance team are truly top-notch—supportive, responsive, and always professional. You really won’t find better.

And the location… there are no words! Being steps away from the Big House and having a front-row seat to all things U-M sports, including the parades, makes this place extra special.

This building is the heart of Ann Arbor, and it will proudly be home to AIR® Ann Arbor for many years to come."
Hoover + Greene,"Living at Hoover + Greene has been an excellent experience! The building is well maintained and has fantastic amenities. Rebecca, Lydia, and Todd are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and helpful. They’ve created a warm and inviting community at H + G and we are so grateful for their hard work."
Foundry Lofts,"Jessica & Andre spent a lot of time showing us around Foundry Lofts. They both went above and beyond what other managers did at previous showings at other Ann Arbor MI apartments. The apartments were clean, amenities amazing, nice furniture, studio was spacious and floor plan the best we have viewed. Because of the attention given to us by Jessica & Andre along with the amazing studio and amenities my son just signed a lease starting fall 2026 and if staying for his PHD he is sure that he will be staying long term at Foundry Lofts :)"
Foundry Lofts,"Got a summer sublease for this place. Do not plan your budget by looking at your housing contract because they add lots of extra costs on top of that. Managers are hard to get in touch and deal with. They don’t try to solve your problems, are very rude, and offer very offensive suggestions.

If you are looking for fall housing options, there are lots of better places around with friendlier managers and more transparent cost. I don’t recommend this place and would not come back for another year."
Foundry Lofts,"Total rip off of a place. They allured us into signing the lease ASAP and promised a bigger room, and when the time came, a month before, assigned us the smallest room possible, with a blocking concrete pillar in the corner. NO way to get a hold of their housing team, no adjustment. Please pay a few extra dollars and get yourself a better apartment, do not fall into their trap."
Foundry Lofts,"As a parent of a UM student, I do not recommend renting from this apartment complex .  Rented a unit the last school year.  There were constant questionable, add on fees, a non-responsive rental office and manager who failed to respond to emails and phone calls.  The place was dirty and not cleaned on move in."
Foundry Lofts,"I have never lived in AA before and this was my first time signing a lease, I dealt with Olivia during my leasing process and she was incredible, she made the process seamless and streamlined. She was an extreme delight to speak with and overall was incredibly insightful and answered every question i had with ease. She was also super accommodating and helpful. Highly recommend Foundry Lofts and Olivia, wouldn't have leased without her!"
Centerra Pointe,"We lived at Centerra Pointe for 3 years and enjoyed our time there. The location is excellent - within walking distance to Target, restaurants, playground, public library, and shops. The property is well maintained - weekly landscaping, repairing sidewalks, new blacktop for the roads, snow removal from sidewalks and roads quickly, etc. The property has strict rules about pets and smoking and quiet hours, which are all upheld. We didn't use the pool much, but the fitness center was nice. Maintenance is super responsive!

One thing to caution and it is not the fault of the property. Deliveries by Amazon are constantly delivered to the wrong apartment. Each building has a different building address, but the same set of apartment numbers. It's super confusing to Amazon delivery drivers who are not familiar with the property and they can never seem to deliver packages to the correct apartment. It doesn't seem to be a problem with FedEx or UPS deliveries. The apartment complex accepts all deliveries, so I recommend taking them up on their offer to accept your packages and then going to pick them up from the office.

Ryan, Hiba, Don, and Ryan (maintenance mgr.) are super friendly and willing to work with us whenever we needed something or had an issue. Thank you Centerra Pointe!"
Centerra Pointe,"I had an amazing experience at this apartment complex and the only reason I departed was to move into a home. From day one, the front office staff was incredibly friendly, professional, and always willing to help with anything I need. Whether it's answering questions, handling packages, or just greeting residents with a smile, they truly go above and beyond. The maintenance team is equally impressive—quick to respond, knowledgeable, and always courteous. Any issue I had was resolved promptly and with care, which makes a huge difference in day-to-day comfort. The apartments themselves are beautiful inside—modern finishes, spacious layouts, and everything is very well-kept. You can tell the property management takes pride in maintaining the units and common areas. One of the things I appreciate most is how safe and clean the entire property feels. The grounds are always tidy, and I feel completely comfortable walking around at any time of day or night. If you're looking for a place that combines great service, beautiful living spaces, and a strong sense of community, this is it. Highly recommend!"
Centerra Pointe,We are very satisfied living at Centerra Pointe. For starters it's a beautiful and a safe place to live. Walking distance from two outdoor shopping centers. Very convenient for us. We get a private garage attached to each unit. It feels like we live in a townhouse. Management team and maintenance team are on site at all times. All our concerns and requests are addressed with a smile and in timely manner. Club house is open to all residents. It has a fully equipped gym. Heated pool during warmer months is located next to the club house. Overall we are happy with the location of this property and the management team.
Centerra Pointe,"I love the apartments, living area distribution, bedroom space, bathroom size and closet size. The location is AMAZING! We can do a lot of things walking and around 3 minutes driving from I-94. I truly recommend Centerra Point."
Centerra Pointe,"I’m always very nervous to begin a new lease at apartment complexes; I have had some horror stories. However, living at Centerra Pointe has been such a breeze. The leasing management team is world class: Hiba and Ryan have been such a pleasure to work with. (And their positivity goes such a long way, because I can’t count how many times I’ve walked into leasing offices and met agents with attitude.)

The apartment units themselves are very spacious and were spotless upon move in. (However, I do suggest that the property invest in different panel flooring, as the floor boards do move around a bit.) anytime I submit a maintenance request, it is usually fixed same day or within 24 hours. And the maintenance team here is just as nice as the leasing office!

The community is well put together and neighbors are friendly. I really have enjoyed living here so, so, so much! I never recommend people living in apartment complexes, but since Centerra Pointe is my first!"
Spruce Knob Apartments,"Unfortunately, it hasn't been a great start. The apartment is fine, and the leasing process was simple - they clearly work hard to sign you.

However, maintenance in the first week of living here has been nonexistent. It's been a while since I've lived in an apartment, so maybe this is the speed of things, but upon move-in, one of the bedrooms was missing a doorknob. I noted this to the office and a maintenance request was created, but a week later, I still don't have a doorknob.

There's also a nest of yellow jackets coming and going from the cement underneath the sliding door, making it so that my son and I can't use it. I've submitted two maintenance requests - both were marked ""completed"" but nothing appears to have been done and the wasps are still there.

The pool has been closed unannounced the last two times we've tried to go. No sign, no email, and the office person didn't seem to know why. It was explained away as some unspecified ""maintenance issue"".

Hoping things improve. Aside from the maintenance issues, I'm happy with the community, the location, and the apartment itself. I had lower expectations going in, given my rush to move, and my budget, and overall it's not bad."
Spruce Knob Apartments,"Until recently, my experience living at Spruce Knob has been mostly positive. I have been a resident for 3 years. Repairs to the air conditioners for my unit and three others have been ongoing now for 2 weeks, and my AC is still not functional. Last weekend, it was very hot and we were not notified repairs wouldn't be completed on the timeline that was initially shared. Thankfully, the outside temperatures have been cooler this week. The communication from McKinley during the repair process has been very disappointing. I and the other residents impacted have mostly relied on one another for updates when we've been able to connect with the contractors directly. I decided to post this review in hopes it leads to positive change and better experiences for other Spruce Knob residents moving forward.

Update: Communication improved at the end of the repairs, and I received daily updates via text from Korey.  The contractor came back on Saturday morning at the end of the second week to resolve the final issue, which was much appreciated. Everything has been working well for the past week."
Spruce Knob Apartments,"I moved into an apartment that already had two plumbing issues and was given the wrong mailbox key. It took them two months to have everything in order after multiple reminders. Some sort of issue with the plumbing would arise at least once every couple of months; sometimes management is fast but sometimes slow.

Be prepared to pay about $50/mo extra for water, sewage, trash, etc. in addition to electricity and gas with DTE—they take the building’s total and divide it by the number of residents and bill each individually.  They did not tell me this when I asked on the phone about utilities before renting.

Management makes up rules and fees with short notice, for example, a penalty for not filling out their special notice to vacate form by 60 days before the end of the lease—which you’re not given or told about until 3:13pm 60 days before the lease ends—even though you’ve notified them in writing months before that you will not be renewing, and requested information on any other protocols or procedures to be aware of. Fortunately I was on top of everything and never got dinged but still, this is another reason for not recommending Spruce Knob.

Overall, the apartments look nice at first but once move-in day arrives, you realize how poorly managed they are when they tell you day-of that you can’t pick up your keys until 4pm. I thought this was one of the better McKinleys, but I guess not. Some aspects of the apartments are good—the appliances work well and they have good sound and temperature insulation, the former being particularly important as the community is right next to I-94. So I very generously rate this place 2/5 stars. But seriously, my advice is just don’t bother. There are much better places in Ypsilanti that are way more affordable."
Spruce Knob Apartments,"We had a wonderful experience with Sarah during our move-in! She was incredibly kind, welcoming, and made the entire process smooth and stress-free. From guiding us through the application to patiently answering all our questions, Sarah went above and beyond to support us. We’re truly grateful for her help and feel lucky to have had her assistance throughout the process."
Spruce Knob Apartments,My experiences living here has been amazing. The maintenance team is very professional and very fast. Manager Korey is also very nice to talk to. I think this is one of the best and most affortable plus safe place to live in Ann Arbor. Highlt reccomended.
Arbor Landings Apartments,Thank you so much for re glazing my bath tub and fixing the towel rack. Thank you for putting the shower head and shower curtain back up!! I appreciate it so much! Shoutout to Craig for being so helpful. It looks awesome! 5 stars!!
Arbor Landings Apartments,"As a previous tenant at Arbor Landings, I was disappointed with our move-in experience.  The new carpeting was installed the morning that we were moving in, the kitchen updates were not completed (and still aren’t: missing mouldings, space between countertop and ledge not spackled or painted), the bathtub has a strip of partially removed adhesive at the floor line.  The apartment was not as clean as it should have been (dirty, dusty vent covers).  Definitely not up to par."
Arbor Landings Apartments,"The last 2 issues have been resolved--shower issues and toilet issues.  They were fixed by David who did a great job.  However, this afternoon trying to do my wash and the washing machine is NOT emptying the rinse water and spinning.  So I have wet clothes sitting in the washing machine."
Arbor Landings Apartments,"I recently moved out after living here for several years. The location is convenient, and management does a great job with the grounds. Maintenance was very responsive to work orders. Staff were always kind and helpful. The complex is very quiet and neighbors are friendly. We did have a couple car break-ins and a vehicle theft; the first thing police said when they pulled up to take a report was...this must be the place for car thefts, this is the third one this month. This isn't the complex's fault, but reflects on the poor security. Be VERY diligent on moving in with documenting the condition of your apartment. I was charged for damages that any other place considers normal wear and tear. The carpet in my apartment was horrible when we moved in-threadbare and stained beyond belief, but I was charged for damage to it. The carpet should have been replaced before I moved in. The kitchen appliances were beat up when I moved in, but I also caught damage charges for them. We truly didn't damage anything beyond typical wear and tear (and we were three adults living there), but I'm not going to argue with the management that nickels and dimes each month, and that charges a $125 move-out inspection fee to your account when you indicate your intention to move out. They require a 90-day notice that you aren't renewing your lease, which is excessive even around here. Your energy bill will be very high and your apartment will be freezing in the winter because insulation is terrible. Water bill makes no sense--our charges were the same even during months that we were only home for two days. You will also be charged $15 for trash and $5 for pest control, which is a tacky thing to do when rent is already so much. The city conducted an inspection after a fire at the complex and found expired smoke detectors in my apartment. The rent is high even for A2 given the rundown condition of the units. Bottom line is: comparison shop and think hard about living here, and document every detail of the unit when you move in, because you will be charged for degradation that other apartments assume is what you pay rent for. Arbor Landings/Solomon squeeze you for ever dollar they can in the end, which leaves a bad taste for the years-long experience of living there. My advice to Arbor Landings/Solomon: sometimes it's better to let a few hundred bucks go, even though it's ""easy"" money to take from the deposit, in exchange for the positive perception of a years-long customer/resident when they leave. Your petty move-out response colored the entire experience as negative."
Arbor Landings Apartments,"Peter, Devin and Chad were an absolute pleasure to work with. They are a credit to Arbor Landings Apartments. I would recommend Arbor Landings based on the customer service provided by these gentlemen."
South Grove Apartments,"I moved in on July 12th, 4 days ago. Since then, I have been experiencing the following terrible issues. The apartment office has made no effort even though I visited the office 3 times.

First, there is an unbearable smell coming from the bathroom. I found that the odor is coming from the bathroom door, which also doesn’t close properly.

Second, the air conditioner is not working, even in this 80 degree heat.

Third, the bathtub is leaking continuously. Not only is this a waste of water, but the sound of running water is driving me crazy.

Fourth, water is leaking from under the kitchen sink, which makes it impossible to do dish comfortably.

In short, do not move into this apartment. These are problems you will be facing. I am seriously concerned about the rest of my lease here."
South Grove Apartments,"Moved in to South Grove Apts about two and a half months ago and thought it was time to provide a Google review.

First off, when I was looking for a place, the associates were glad to show me available units, no surprise. Nick was glad to take me through the units TWICE, spent as much time as I wanted and provided the unit layouts with measurements for walls and windows to help me out with planning. Service plus. When we got back to the office, the other associated seemed surprised at how long we out. I guess it wasn't typical for a double visit to units, but Nick hooked me up and was all patience and informative.

When I moved in Nick and Dia were extremely helpful in getting me set up with the company web site, how to use it, set up visa and bank accounts, and also utility monthly info and how the payments worked. I don't use it, but SG implemented a policy for residents that they can pay throughout the month using a flexible rent payment routine. Another indication that residents come first here.

I'd had some issues with Ann Arbor apt living in past years owing to seemingly lax maintenance operations. Not here at SG. Lindsey Stallsmith, the SG Manager is always attentive to work orders with me. The response is almost always same day, and she takes care on follow-up. She always has a smile and a good word when I am in the office, really friendly and helpful. It says something when I know the folks in the office team. It's a good relationship and they are always there to help no problem. Like I said, residents are a priority, especially after move-in! As for the maintenance guys, Gregory and Charles have helped me a lot and are capable and informative about any issues. When they see me out in the complex, they always have a good word and an update on whatever work is going on. Lindsey is also taking care of making sure residents know about general work projects going on in the complex, like pavement work for example. The little parties they throw at the pool or the office and Halloween for the kids are a good place to get snacks and see the other residents.

I've read other reviews about the SG appliances being rather old, but they seem to be on a remod kick, and on turnover in apartments they are updating appliances and counter tops, etc. Had an issue with a stove top burner and Charles hooked me up right away. You aren't left without at SG.

I'm enjoying the apartment living here not least because it's quiet and friendly. I mean really quiet, mellow. When I do see other residents they are pretty friendly too. The large sliding glass door in the living room is eight foot across and it gives me a nice view out onto the common area, full of trees and grass and I can watch folks walking their dogs and chilling out. I really like the view and the bright light it lets in. I've got a storage closet for extra stuff located in the building and I keep the bike there along with some other stuff. Handy. Always a park spot close to the building front door. No problem getting deliveries. Even the mailman is friendly.

Adam from Maintenance is in right now working on the kitchen counter caulking. Another good job for me.

Great place overall, thanks to Lindsey, Dia, Nick, Adam, Charles and Gregory for the making apartment living here comfortable  and easy for me. Best

South Grove Apartments,New management is much better and office staff is very quick to respond and very helpful. Maintenance always showed up either same day or the next day when a request was made. Over the years rent has gone up an extreme amount in 2019 when I moved in rent was only 850; when I moved out this year my rent was 1300 for the same apartment no upgrades. Along with the price increases the indoor pool was also permanently closed. For future renters the complex is relatively safe but is very close to I-94 and at night there are often people who race on the freeway and hit the rumble strips and you will hear that in your home. The layout of the apartments are very nice and I will miss the massive walk-in closet. It was a nice place to live but I will not miss the freeway noise. Management was also surprisingly fast at sending back my security deposit.
South Grove Apartments,"I had such a great experience with this apartment complex from the very start. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful throughout the entire process. My tour was informative and gave me a really good feel for the community. What stood out the most was how responsive everyone was, whether I had questions over the phone, through email, or in person, they always took the time to help me out. Moving into a new place can be stressful, but they made it feel easy and exciting. Highly recommend!"
South Grove Apartments,"safety violations are ignored until fines become more expensive than the fix.

The apartments do not meet the minimum building code for insulation and you heating and cooling bill will be insane.

Their maintenance staff is so understaffed that a broken bathroom sink takes approximate a month to fix, but they wont hire more or use contractor when they are overwhelmed.

Repairs and improvements are not planned, these are slumlords. Live somewhere else.

Edit: I've spoken to your office enough to last me a lifetime. You've heard about every one of these complaints several times and the only time you ever took action is when I rbiught city insectors. Every single time your budget was the reason you gave me. Fire extinguishers, falling branches, Doors that have 2"" if ice buildup inside the apartment, fixing none of that was in the budget. I've moved out and I won't ever willingly speak with anyone that works for you again."
The Haven of Ann Arbor,"I would honestly give this place ZERO stars if I could. I had a good experience in the beginning, but after being here for a while, I am deeply disappointed and devastated in how it is run. Feel like I’m being punished for being a good resident. It’s complete and utter bs. If you want a place to listen to your concerns, The Haven Of Ann Arbor is not the place. Even contacting management of management doesn’t do anything and it’s a shame. It takes a lot for me to get upset, but The Haven Of Ann Arbor has done more than that. They have ruined all of my good memories and replaced them with dread and disappointment. You should probably reevaluate and get your priorities straight. I would not recommend becoming a resident here. Don’t waste your time. I’m sure there are plenty of other places that would give you less of a headache."
The Haven of Ann Arbor,"I've been a resident of the Haven for 3 years now. I cannot in good conscience recommend this estate to anyone who has a modicum of self respect.

For one, the management here have their priorities completely skewed. My previous upstairs neighbors would stomp on the floor and blast music at 4am at least once a week and management refused to contact them despite it in clear violation of the lease agreement. Only after they had terminated their lease, they sent an empty threat to a completely empty apartment. Even after they quite literally flooded my apartment at midnight, management refused to resolve the issue. I had to call maintenance to enter my neighbor's apartment and fix their flooded toilet.

I had been in contact with management for over 6 months about my noise complaints and my water damaged apartment and closet where the ceiling flooded. The haven took nearly 2 months to respond, despite repeated calls and emails. As mentioned earlier, they only tool action once my neighbours had terminated their lease.

The sheer audacity of the management's behavior has been the final straw for me. Once again, no one with any semblance of self respect should violate their own dignity by dealing with the depraved company that manages the estate.

It is both baffling and insulting that the management thinks such behaviour is acceptable. It is no surprise that the owners of estate has changed multiple hands in my stay here. Despite this, the pathetic management here has managed to persist.

These examples only scratch the surface of the frequent disagreements and complaints I've had with management. Once my upstairs neighbours caused a small leak through the airconditioning vents which stained my ceiling while I was on vacation. When maintenance came they ""solved"" the issue by spray painting the ceiling. The only issue however, was that they didn't put up any protection, and splattered the carpets and the walls with the paint. I called them again to resolve the issue, and it took more than 3 requests and 6 months of communication before maintenance actually showed up.

To conclude, if you have any desire to live in a well maintained, quiet apartment with minimal conflict with maintenance and management, the haven is not for you. There is another estate just next to the haven that may possibly be better managed and is located in a similar location. look elsewhere. These examples are snapshots of the enormous number of minor spats, conflicts and arguments I've had with the haven to persuade them to take any meaningful action to maintain the apartment to a reasonable standard or to respect their end of the lease agreement. No one should be subject to such petty inconveniences for the premium price that they charge.

I have consulted a lawyer about this matter and will be taking further action against them for violating their portion of the lease agreement. If being subject to any of this pointless conflict and legal disagreement excites you, then by all means, join the haven."
The Haven of Ann Arbor,"I have been a resident at The Haven for more than a decade.  The management maintains the property well.  The maintenance crew is prompt, polite, and effective.  The rent is fair.  Most important, the management office is courteous, kind, and helpful.  My cat got lost on the grounds recently, and Kelly, a leasing agent, circulated emails and coordinated action with a couple of the other tenants to find my cat and return him safely to me.  Kelly's help went above and beyond the call of duty.  Her  generous kindness represents the spirit of the management staff at The Haven."
The Haven of Ann Arbor,"We really appreciate our time at Haven - it is such a beautiful and peaceful place for family to live. We in particular appreciate Jeff, who is so friendly all the time in helping us with home maintenance issues. He also went beyond in sending us mails that arrived after we moved out. The interactions with him have always been a pleasure. He made things so much easier for us."
The Haven of Ann Arbor,"I was initially very interested in leasing a unit at The Haven of Ann Arbor—the property itself looked great and seemed like it could be a good fit. Unfortunately, my experience with the management team was extremely disappointing. Trying to get in touch with the property manager to ask even basic questions was incredibly frustrating. Communication was slow, inconsistent, and unprofessional, which left me with serious concerns about how issues might be handled if I became a tenant. Ultimately, I decided not to move forward with the lease solely because of the poor management experience. I hope the team improves their responsiveness and professionalism for future prospective residents."
Woodview Commons,We love our green space at Woodview Commons. Lauren and  Abby super friendly and really care about this complex and its renters!  They encourage meeting others by hosting an event per month!
Woodview Commons,"We have lived here since April of this year and have absolutely loved it! Lauren, Abbey, and Matt are all very helpful and attentive. The move-in process was seamless, and Lauren made sure we found the perfect apartment to fit our needs. As someone who works in real estate, I’m particular about where I live, and Woodview has consistently exceeded my expectations.

Here are some highlights:

- Great amenities that are taken care of. The gym, pool, and hot tub are always clean. Staff ensures that there are not unaccompanied guests using the amenities, which we can all appreciate.
- Very dog friendly community. The dual-sided dog park is great for different sizes and temperaments. There are always dog treats in the leasing office, and dog bag stations are regularly checked.
- Maintenance is super friendly and fast. They make a point to get to know people in the community.
- Staff is very quick to address any and all issues including people parking in reserved spots, lost items, issues with amenities, misuse of community areas, etc. They always answer phone calls and emails promptly.
- The neighborhood is very quiet and all our neighbors have been friendly and respectful. We have made many new friends since we moved in. Everyone is inclusive and inviting.
- Our apartment has not had any issues. Our energy bill has been low, even cheaper than my last apartment that was half the size. We rarely hear neighbors, although we are on the top floor.
- Lots of parking options for residents, including uncovered, carports, garages, and EV charging spots. The only thing to note is that guest parking is limited to the leasing office. There is no open parking in front of buildings.
- The area always feels safe. Because of the location, there aren't a bunch of people wandering into the community. All the sidewalks and roads are well-lit. The package lockers are easy to use and offer peace of mind when you're away from home.
- The leasing office regularly holds resident events which are not only fun, but a great way to meet other people in the community.

If you're looking for a modern, updated home that's at a great price point, Woodview is a great option. It's about 5-10 minutes to nearby food and grocery stores, and 15-20 minutes to central downtown Ann Arbor. Overall, I'm so glad we chose Woodview Commons as our home and can't recommend it enough!"
Woodview Commons,"I moved in this March, and after almost 8 months, I can confidently say this has been one of the most lovely and peaceful living experiences I’ve had.

You can immerse yourself in nature, listening to birds chirping and frogs croaking. It’s incredibly quiet and relaxing, perfect for unwinding after a long day. The pool was a highlight during the summer—clean, calm, and just fantastic. The pickleball courts are well maintained, and the gym is top quality.

But what truly sets this place apart is the amazing staff.
Abbey, Lauren, and Matt are always kind, professional, and truly helpful. They respond quickly, treat residents with warmth, and make this place feel like home.

They also host wonderful monthly events that bring the community together. Thanks to these events, I’ve met friendly and diverse neighbors, made new friends, and felt a real sense of belonging.

I honestly feel so lucky to live here. It’s not just an apartment—it’s a vibrant and welcoming community.
Highly recommended!"
Woodview Commons,"(Note: I will update this post after 6 months to see if my opinion changes~)

First of all: It’s the best move-in experience I’ve ever had. Everything (bathroom, kitchen, refrigerator, internet, laundry) was ready to use by the day of move-in - even though this is a brand-new apartment. It might sound absurd to say, but I honestly didn’t expect everything to work perfectly since the building had just been completed two weeks before we moved in. But everything really did work fine, and the Woodview team even had the apartment cleaned again the day before we arrived. I couldn’t find a single speck of dust anywhere.

Staff: We’ve had great communication with Lauren, who is extremely helpful with our moving process and generally replies to emails very quickly (usually within a day, except weekends). Abbey also helped us during move-in and was extremely helpful in resolving a WIFI issue. We once submitted a service request about adjusting the shower temperature, and the maintenance team responded within a day. Overall, the Woodview team seems to maintain a strong culture of communication, which I rarely see elsewhere. I hope this continues as more people move in.

Now, some of the good sides and some practical limitations that I have noticed~

Room type: Apartment 2B2B + a den
1.	The apartment itself is beautiful. Our unit faces the pond, so the view is gorgeous, and there’s a small trail outside leading to the clubhouse. At night it’s generally very quiet, with only the sound of crickets.

2.	Many of the built-in finishes are nice: granite surfaces in areas with water, which shows care and suggests they’re aiming for long-term residents. The kitchen is also very nice and spacious.

Amenities:
There’s a pickleball court, pool, spa, gym, etc. There’s also an app to book the court in advance, which is very convenient. Since people are still moving in, the amenities are currently quite empty. I’ll update this in 6 months to see how it develops.

Practical limitations:
1.	Location: It’s not very close to downtown Ann Arbor. It usually takes ~20 minutes to drive to U-M, sometimes ~30 minutes with traffic. Nearby stores are limited (mainly a Meijer). Most plazas take at least ~15 minutes to reach.

2.	Noise from upstairs: As another review mentioned, we can hear footsteps from the floor above. It doesn’t bother us much, but it may matter for others. Since it’s move-in season, I assume the noise from people moving furniture around is more obvious than other seasons.

3.	Smell: Being a new building, unable there was a paint-like smell when we moved in. It faded over time and was unnoticeable after about a week.

4.	Package delivery: The delivery system is still a bit inconsistent. I set my address to my apartment, but sometimes packages end up in the leasing office locker and sometimes at my door. The current pattern seems to be small packages → leasing office locker, large packages → door delivery. Hopefully this will become more standardized over time.

Overall: I would rate this 4.5 out of 5 for my ~2 weeks here so far. Most of the current issues seem like things that will improve over time, and I trust the team. Haven’t experienced winter yet, so we’ll see!"
Woodview Commons,"The neighborhood is quiet, safe, and still developing, which means it’s only going to get better with time. I also appreciate the responsive Lauren McMahan, the Neighborhood Leasing Manager.  She has been quick to address any questions during the move in process.
Overall, this townhouse exceeded my expectations. It’s the perfect blend of comfort, style, and practicality. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a modern and low-maintenance home!"
Mill Creek Townhomes,"My honest experience as a current resident.

I’ve lived at Millcreek Townhomes long enough to understand both the positives and the ongoing challenges here. The community is generally quiet, and my unit itself is comfortable. I’ve always made sure my payments and documentation were handled properly, often working with SOS Community Services to keep everything accurate and on time.

A major part of my experience, however, has been dealing with repeated billing confusion. I’ve had unexpected charges show up on my account, including fees I needed SOS to help me get reviewed or corrected. It has taken several follow-ups each time just to get accurate information about my own ledger, which becomes stressful when you’re trying to stay on top of things.

Communication can also be inconsistent. There were times I wouldn’t get clear answers until I involved SOS, which shouldn’t be necessary for routine questions.

Another thing worth mentioning is the lack of washer and dryer access in my particular unit. The section I live in simply wasn’t built with washer/dryer hookups, so residents like me don’t have the option to install one. I’ve accepted that this is how the units in this part of the property are set up, but it’s something future tenants should be aware of when choosing their building or layout.

I’m sharing this review to be transparent about what my experience has been. I take care of my home, communicate, and pay what I owe  and I expect the same consistency and clarity from management. I hope they improve their responsiveness, accuracy, and overall follow-through moving forward."
Mill Creek Townhomes,"I have had a good experience so far. The neighborhood is quite, and it seems like any crime that happens is posted to social media, so I feel pretty safe here too. The leasing office did their best to give us a good experience, plus the application fee was like 10$ so you're more than welcome to apply (hint: see the bad reviews). The home is very nice and the maintenance team is professional and accommodating. I've lived in many places and if you're a renter on the south side of Ann Arbor this place is certainly worth it.
Again, thank you for the experience We're very pleased with the maintenance and we feel at home.
P.S. The park next door is definitely a ""city park"", but that doesn't really cause problems in the neighborhood."
Mill Creek Townhomes,"This property is gorgeous, with a park, frisbee golf a wetland preserve and an amazing staff! The maintenance is on point and fixes any issues faster than anywhere I have lived. The office staff is kind, professional and they seem to actually care! Kyle and Lexi were helpful honest and professional and the manager was incredibly kind when we were getting situated and dealing with an issue as we got ready to move in.  The only issue I have is that your only Internet option is Xfinity which has the worst customer service you will find and the speeds never match what is promised.. I still love this place and highly recommend it!"
Mill Creek Townhomes,"I have been living at Mill Creek Townhomes for 4 years, and I couldn't be happier with my experience!

The management and maintenance teams are top-notch—always responsive, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile to ensure residents are comfortable. Any maintenance requests I've submitted have been handled quickly and efficiently.

The community amenities are also a huge bonus—the pool, clubhouse, and dog park are my personal favorites and make living here even more enjoyable.

Mill Creek is a wonderful place to live!"
Mill Creek Townhomes,"I've lived here for just under a year, and so far I really like it!

I shopped around for apartments and by far this spot is the best bang for your buck, the quality is better than other spots I viewed at the same price point in the area. I was nervous that because we got in at a great price point they would raise our rent but I already got my lease for the new lease year, and it has stayed the same, which I was super grateful for!

I haven't had many problems but anything I've needed, maintenance is quick to get someone out. And they've been on top of their city inspections this year making sure everything is up to code.

Gavin and Cass came and updated my fire alarms today after the city had marked them as out of date. They were super friendly and quick! :)"
State Street Village Apartments,"One stars because there’s damage to the unit prior to our lease causing our utility bill to be $800 a month regardless of speaking with maintenance it was said that it’d be fixed wasn’t ”fixed”. Debris and garbage all around the property. Old maintenance man actually grabbed my shoulder which is battery but suddenly the camera footage of the office disappeared.
Also my wife was broken in on while showering by the same maintenance man, doors locked knocked briefly and then proceeded to use his key to enter as my wife walked down the stairs in a towel.
Excuse from management was the notice to inspect auto offs (things above stove below microwaves) must have blown off the door."
State Street Village Apartments,"This place comes with good condition, nice and tranquil surrounding. Graduate students / PHD will love the vibe here. I would say more study space would add a huge plus in the future!"
State Street Village Apartments,So far this has been an A+++++ experience. Communication has been spot on. After our last experience this has been a huge relief. Thanks so much to you ALL and especially Javairia. She has been amazing and helpful. Also thanks to Emily for phone call and communication!!
State Street Village Apartments,One thing I respect the most is the maintenance team. They are very reliable. They respond swiftly and complete the work in due time without delay.
State Street Village Apartments,"So far it looks pretty safe and everything they promised online is what you get. However, it is ridiculous that the rooms do not have personal door locks unless you install yours. The lighting in the apartment is another matter, gives the apartment a dull look in my opinion.
Another problem is the leasing office, my previous apartment has a leasing office where at least one physical person is there to help and when packages arrive, you are sure it is safe during the open hours. Here is another matter entirely, the leasing office is almost always closed and when you do call, there is almost never someone to answer or help, which is frustrating. This also makes package delivery tricky as vendors deliver my package to different locations around the apartment and I have to do a hide and seek for my own package, because delivery location is tricky and the leasing office does not handle it. I am quite disappointed.
I however complained to the manager and the lighting in my room was changed and upgraded. The leasing office hours have been extended and more accessible, although the delivery location of packages now varies. And the neighbor with their dogs (a floor above) will frustrate the saint out of you as the walls are thin-proofed and you can hear everything. The location is very secure and quiet but the rent is a bit on the quite expensive side. And it gets increased every renewal year (a fact I have to get used to)."
618 South Main,"As a multi-year resident in the building I have had a good experience living here! Amenities are great (gym, pool, common areas).

I would give a 5 star rating normally but to talk about the overall experience you hear the trains butt you know  know what you are signing up for.

There has been only 1 change over in management that I have experienced. Relatively good, all things considered - key maintenance addressed washer dryer issue almost immediately upon discover during management adjustment, Andrew Trout really helped there to make that happen.

Most all issues are addressed quickly building wide or for my specific apartment. Rarely have I had longstanding issues with my apartment thanks to maintenance operations."
618 South Main,"I have lived at several properties over the years, and 618 S Main is undoubtedly the best. The property is impeccably maintained and cared for. The office staff, especially Alex and Shavon, are exceptional and responsive. They regularly organize resident events and maintain a festive atmosphere during the holidays. The gym and pool facilities are excellent. The location is ideal, with easy walking access to all downtown Ann Arbor restaurants. I've enjoyed living here for 3 years already and plan to stay even longer."
618 South Main,"This place has seriously gone downhill since Krista left. The only competent person remaining is the maintenance guy—he's great and always helpful. But everything else has declined.

The community events used to be something I looked forward to. Krista once organized a full catered soup bar that was genuinely delicious. Now? The new team put out two crock pots of undercooked frozen soup. It was gross. When someone politely brought this up, they were basically laughed out of the room—as if it was wrong to expect quality.

There was also a “Coke Day,” which was literally just handing out cans of soda from a fridge. No thought or effort (at least grab the glass bottles if you’re going to do something like that).

The biggest disappointment is that they raised my rent by over $200 this year, yet I’m getting less than I did before. No improvements, no upgrades, and a steep decline in what used to make this place feel like a community.

Nothing works anymore, and the events that made living here enjoyable are gone. This is my last lease—definitely not worth it anymore."
618 South Main,"I lived here during my senior year at Michigan and couldn’t recommend it enough! The amenities were always kept in great condition, and the location is perfect. The entire staff is honest and hardworking, and happy to help with any issues that may come up. I’ve lived and experienced a few different apartments in Ann Arbor, and 618 certainly outshines them all."
618 South Main,"Been living here for more than one year. Okay location. Nice layout. HOWEVER:
(1) WiFi has been down twice and each time it took forever for them to fix.
(2) There’s NO HOT WATER most days this week. They said the contractor will fix this problem on Friday and then we didn’t get any updates. Saturday morning you realized that okay they haven’t fixed the problem and you don’t know when you can expect a hot shower.
[update] They sent out an email to ask everyone not to place further notice as they are “actively working on this” in the morning and then disappeared. It’s end of Saturday and we residents still don’t have hot water. Essentially, if you just google it, there are plenty of service providers that claim to have it fixed in 24 hours. Don’t get why they can be so irresponsible.

Extremely slow, unreliable , unresponsive and inefficient on dealing with these important issues."
Surrey Park,Cute small park near condos and more housing.  But a nice walking/running trail that is like 1 mile around.  A duck pond and beautiful trees!
Surrey Park,"Had an amazing tour with Destini H! She was extremely helpful, personable, and very knowledgeable about the property. I appreciated how smooth she made the entire process!"
Surrey Park,"When I first moved into this apartment, it hadn't been cleaned at all. There were five large spiders and countless small ones hiding in every drawer corner. Cockroaches were crawling on the ceiling. When I complained to the leasing office, they told me the unit had been vacant for three months. In other words, it hadn’t been cleaned after the previous tenant moved out, nor before I moved in.

Then, starting in September during the fall season, stink bugs took over the entire neighborhood. They came in daily through the poorly sealed door, and dead bugs would pile up in the space between the two entrance doors. Every day, I had to battle bugs stuck to the door just to get inside. Near the door, bugs were constantly crawling on the carpet, and there were always dead ones.

And most of all, they told me there was an in-unit washer even for studio apartments. But once I moved in, I found out that washers were only available in one-bedroom units and up. Of the two communal laundry rooms that were supposed to be available, they closed one due to ""low usage,"" so I had to carry my laundry across to the far end of the complex, taking about 15 minutes round trip just to do laundry.

In the bathroom, there was a persistent sewage smell. Even though I cleaned the toilet with bleach weekly, the odor coming from below wouldn’t go away. Since the kitchen was right next to the bathroom, I couldn’t eat with the door open, and if I closed it, the smell would build up and hit me every time I went in. The bathroom fan also smelled musty and dusty, and turning it on only made things worse.

This apartment is quiet and feels safe overall, the maintenance people are nice and quick, but on Friday and Saturday nights, the smell of marijuana is noticeable. If you're okay with bugs and a small, old unit, this place is affordable. But if you can’t bear waking up every day to fight bugs, this is not the place for you."
Surrey Park,"I lived at Surrey Park for 2 years and had a great experience all around.  The staff, specifically Jason, the property manager, and the maintenance guys, always went above and beyond to address any issues that came up or questions I had.  The location is great and the community is very safe and quiet.  I loved having laundry in unit and a huge attic, plus a little patio to myself, and I always had peace of mind knowing the management and maintenance team had my back.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a more affordable, quieter complex compared to most places in Ann Arbor."
Surrey Park,"I lived here for 6 months and it was a very nice place to live. I arrived on a Saturday around 8 pm, it was rainy and maintenance was able to hand over the keys. The apartments and the grounds are kept in very good conditions. My apartment was a non-renovated one but still was very good, all appliances worked without a problem. Maintenance was always very quick with they're response (I didn't have major issues). I never had an issue with noise.
Never had a problem with parking.
Jason and all the staff was always super nice and helpful. All of them.
I recommend this place to live and it's affordable, close to a target and Downtown."
ReNew Ann Arbor,"I think that this is the first Google review I have ever written and that should tell you all you need to know about ReNew.  Over the course of 8 years of experience in the Navy, living in 7 different states, I have never had an experience with a rental company this unprofessional.  Over the course of a 4 month stretch of Midwest winter, we had to put in around 4-5 maintenance requests for our heat and hot water not working.  I’m a former electrician, so several times I included a full write-up of troubleshooting that I attempted within the reasonable allowance of what a tenant should troubleshoot. Despite this fact, several times the maintenance team showed up (while I was gone), assumed that my girlfriend didn’t know what she was talking about because we had a space heater running, did nothing, and left.

Despite months of inconsistent heat and hot water, ReNew attempted to raise our rent $200/month.  Attempts to contact renew by phone or in person often go nowhere.  For anyone who decides to move in despite this review, here’s an invaluable piece of advice: on at least some of the models of water heater, if you open the pilot window cover, you’ll see a small red rod with wires connected to it.  This is a reset for the internal thermopile, that it seems like none of the maintenance team know about.  If your pilot light goes out and won’t relight, this is probably the culprit.  Press it inward gently, you’ll feel a slight click, and then you should be able to relight your pilot.  As always, never perform work on energized circuits and always follow proper posted procedures and precautions for equipment."
ReNew Ann Arbor,"The first review I read about Renew Ann Arbor said not to live here. I thought that it couldn’t possibly be that bad… I was wrong. Please, please, please don’t choose to live here. It looks nice from the outside. If only they spent as much money on repairing the insides of their units as they did on landscaping. Repeated lies from a dysfunctional - to put it nicely - management team (team as in 1 person, maybe 2, lots of turnover so who knows really). Our apartment has flooded twice within 12 months from the second floor unit’s plumbing mishaps, the AC unit repeatedly broke, the heat would all of a sudden stop kicking on in the winter, they have zero clue who is paying for rental parking spots, they didn’t replace the soiled carpet before we moved in despite the previous tenant having pets (I was told it was replaced), and much more. Hopefully you read this so you can see through their lies on your tour of the property. Despite the way they make it seem, nothing is in order whatsoever at this property. Good luck getting ahold of management by phone (you have to show up at the office in person to get anything addressed in a timely manner). They also don’t know how to work their maintenance request platform in the office - their maintenance crew is the only thing keeping this complex afloat. Maintenance crew is great… just lacking any support from the management side."
ReNew Ann Arbor,"The built in bookshelves are not worth it!!

I never leave reviews, but my experience here was so bad I feel obligated to warn others. The apartment looked cute at first, but it was disgusting when I moved in — hair in the drain, grime in the bathroom, even an old soap bar stuck in the tub.

Management is unresponsive and full of excuses about “system errors.” My microwave broke in December and wasn’t replaced until April. My key card for amenities didn’t work for most of my lease, and when it finally did, the areas were dirty unless tours were happening. The pool didn’t open until late July.

Utilities are overpriced and to top it all off I had to threaten legal action just to get my security deposit back. The aesthetics aren’t worth the constant frustration. Save yourself the headache and live somewhere else."
ReNew Ann Arbor,"DO NOT MOVE HERE.

You will not get what you pay for. I moved in in March. Still here on the one year lease.

I could write a diatribe but I'll keep it concise.

I told them before moving in the reasons I was. I wanted garage parking (I couldn't get a working garage door opener for over a month.)

I told them I wanted to use the Jacuzzi at the apartment gym.

The jacuzzi for the entirety of this year has maybe worked about 10 days. THEY MARKET the hell out of amenities that don't actually work.

When you ask when they will be working you just given an endless list of BS excuses of so called fixes coming up.

Most maintenance requests take forever to get to or are simply ignored.

A bunch of stuff wasn't working in my apartment the day I moved in and took weeks to fix.

If you want to overpay, have amenities they market to pull you in not work, have poor maintenance and hear endless excuses, then this place is for you.

If you don't want endless BS and get what you actually pay for avoid this place at all costs."
ReNew Ann Arbor,We lived at Renew for two years and just moved out because we bought a house. We are very thankful for Renew overall. The customer service with Zac leading the way was fantastic. The location is unreal. I work at the University of Michigan so you just couldn't beat how close we were. We had everything we needed within 10 minutes and somethings were within a minute! We had a baby for the last 2 years and it was a great start to his life living at Renew. Having the garage to park in was clutch and the ice and snow removal on the roads were really good. Just make sure to contact Renew for things you need fixed and they usually did a very good job getting those things done in a timely manner.
Ponds Of Georgetown,"I have loved living here! The apartments are updated and are in a great location. The bus route takes you right up to UM, and the bus comes about every 15 minutes, so you don’t need to worry about parking. Never had to worry about parking at the apartment complex either. The community is always clean and quiet, and any maintenance requests are fixed ASAP. Any time I need something fixed, it is done in less than 24 hours! The Ponds backs up to a nice neighborhood that is great to walk in too. There are events hosted at the clubhouse and the pool is open in the summer time.

The folks in the office as also so great to work with. They helped my roommate and I out with some difficulties with our lease, and they took it upon themselves to contact the property management to advocate for us. It made the process for us so smooth!

Overall, this place has been an excellent place to live, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
Ponds Of Georgetown,"its been such a positive experience living here and I could not recommend it more. First, it’s a beautiful place to live. The ponds are a delight and having a view of the big pond and the bridge to the little island is a treat every single day. It’s very well maintained, the dog park is great, the walking paths are lovely, and the pool area is beautiful, I feel proud to live here. The parking lot is never too crowded and because its off a main street you wont have cars cutting through the parking lot snd speeding by all hours of the night. Second, the apartments interiors are great. The appliances look nice and all work well. The quality is in the detail. There are ceiling lights in every room, the laundry is excellent, the entire apartment space is laid out well, water pressure great with instant hot water and it feels like a complete little home for my boyfriend and I. Its a great place for adults, probably better suited to students and academics than children, because it is so quiet.Third, you will not have a better with a maintenance team than with the hard-working guys at ponds of georgetown. Work requests are handled quickly and with great care. It was a good shock last week when maintenance dropped by to do a preventative check of the various smoke alarms, make sure the heat came on and burned off the dust, and changed the air filter. We feel taken care of and if you’re looking for a beautiful, peaceful, enjoyable place to live this is it."
Ponds Of Georgetown,"I stayed in this apartment for 3 years and liked the view to the ponds in front of balcony.
Good enough space and very efficient and responsible management team. They helped me until the last minutes of my leaving day. I appreciate it !"
Ponds Of Georgetown,"I stopped by to inquire for a friend that is moving to AA. I had lived here some years back and thought it was a great place. I spoke with a visiting leasing agent, Jennifer, and I knew once again that this was the place. She was so genuine, with a big personality. More than that, Jennifer was helpful and knowledgeable. Noe, the great maintenance lead (was there doing my stay), came in and he was as nice and personable as always. I have nothing but good things to say (once again)."
Ponds Of Georgetown,"Awesome place, excellent location, and apartments has new everything, from carpet, light fixtures cabinet counters, doors down to the plugs and covers. outside grounds are very well kept up,maintained and beautiful. swimming pool has always been perfect. Love this place."
The Ivanhoe Apartments,"Hardwood floors, very spacious, and great pool. Quiet community and respectful neighbors. Free parking, close to downtown, pet friendly and great coffee shops within walking distance (York and Roos Roast)."
The Ivanhoe Apartments,"Set up an appointment to see a unit, and they stood me up!

My friend moved here recently, and they say they had issues with the wrong keys given before move in! These employees have serious issues in the upstairs department. Now management and maintenance are ignoring them about maintenance items, as well as items getting destroyed in basement after rains, as well as cracks in walls in basement letting water in and windows leaking water in basement.
This management company is terrible! They are literally trying to compete and beat McKinley for worst landlord in Ann Arbor."
The Ivanhoe Apartments,Pamela and Ellise were very professional and accommodating.  I called and asked if possible to schedule a tour that day. They were able to do it.  The apartments we saw were refurbished.  They looked very nice and clean. They took the time to answer our questions. We had a very positive experience.
The Ivanhoe Apartments,"Scheduled an appointment for a tour and was stood up.  No guidance on where to find leasing office, which was not obvious at all and required asking tenants.  Even tried to reschedule and they never responded."
The Ivanhoe Apartments,"Convenient location and the layout of the apartments is nice. Shifts in management have made communication inconsistent, pool pump was broken most of last summer and couldn't get access this year because everyone thought it was someone else's business. I wonder if there are structural issues that cause it to keep being acquired by different management companies? Nice neighbors."
Briar Cove Terrace Apartments,"Exceptional Property Manager!
Kate is absolutely amazing! She’s professional, responsive, and genuinely cares about the residents and the property. Every question or concern is handled quickly and efficiently, and she always goes above and beyond to make sure everything runs smoothly. It’s rare to find someone who combines great communication, organization, and warmth the way Kate does. Easily top tier property manager to work with. Highly recommend. She truly makes living here an enjoyable experience!"
Briar Cove Terrace Apartments,"Great experience since the first time I walked into the leasing office everyone was friendly and not ""im just here for a job"" demeanor that I've experienced at other apartment complexes and any inquiries ive had that a leasing agent wasnt able to answer i was able to get an in person response, not just an email, from the property manager kate, i was really impressedat not only being accessible she was but also accommodating as well. If i made an appointment or if i just came into the office, granted if she wasnt in a meeting, i felt like my time was respected. And if i had a maintenance inquiry i was able to speak with the supervisor and he was very knowledgeable and accommodating as well. Its a great location, if I were able I would have moved here sooner."
Briar Cove Terrace Apartments,"The first month in our unit was nice, then it rained and we noticed a leak coming in through our balcony. Reported it as soon as we noticed and were told it was a priority to get fixed. There was mold and paint chipping in our unit for at least 4 month with no effort in support for us. We paid thousands to terminate our lease early because of problems stacking up, then they charged us even more money in supposed damage they never submitted proof of. With no communication they sent the debt straight to collections. Even the agent assigned to my account seemed confused about the case. Would not recommend these over priced units to my worst enemy. There were also mice found in our unit on multiple occasions, and an incident where they left our door open and unlocked and became unreachable once we brought it up.

Edit: I saw they replied requesting to talk via email. I've sent multiple emails in regards to the situation and did not get a genuine response once."
Briar Cove Terrace Apartments,"Going on three years of living here. It started out fine, but nearly every summer the pool has been closed for indefinite periods of time. The amenities are not consistently or properly maintained, and I would not recommend living here unless you’re comfortable with marketed amenities being unavailable."
Briar Cove Terrace Apartments,"Had a tour at Briar Cove, and I must say the property manager Kate was amazing very informative and helpful, she broke down the lease in great detail for me and was very professional, and unlike the other properties in the area, I really enjoyed my tour here Kate and her staff were awesome!!"
The Highlands Apartments,"Had a wonderful experience living here for the past two years. The staff was incredibly warm and kind, especially the building manager Kristine, and never had any issue that wasn’t fixed in less than a day. The location is not only conveniently close to North Campus and a few shops and Kroger, but Central was less than a twenty minute bus ride via the Bursley stop five minutes away. Overall, a great experience."
The Highlands Apartments,"Honestly an amazing place to live. The location is great, near a wonderful shopping center and very close to university. The maintenance team is AMAZING. Anytime my roommate or I have ever put in a maintenance request, it has always been handled within 8!!!!! Hours!!!!!. We honestly can’t believe how productive and non-procrastinatory highlands is. Can’t recommend it enough."
The Highlands Apartments,"Very nice place to live on North Campus. Competitive prices with other locations on North and much cheaper than Central Campus. It is nice to have the largest apartment out of my friends at around 1000 sq ft for a two bedroom unit cheaper than other smaller apartments nearby. The apartments are well maintained by the kind and helpful management staff. Brenda, the property manager, is very easy to reach, is prompt to get things done, and will let you know if there will be, if any, delays. The apartments come unfurnished. There are also outdoor picnic areas, a basketball court, and a pool."
The Highlands Apartments,"I cannot express how much I have loved being a resident here for the last three years. The only reason I’m moving out is because I graduated and am trying to move away from the school. I’ll give a ridiculously long review so it’s thorough.

Tl;dr is that while the buildings themselves are old and the laundry situation is inconvenient, the units are reasonably priced and are made worth it by the amount of space inside, the location for students, the communal outdoor space, and most importantly the amazing management and maintenance team. We moved in specifically because of reviews of the management and it’s been absolutely worth it.

Some of these cons for me are personal, some I included for fairness:

Cons:
-There is no in-unit laundry and there are only a couple of machines per building that are coin-operated. There is no change machine. They’re also a little old.
-The set up is strange in that we were on the first floor and had to go down two levels to get to our apartment.
-There is no fitness center
-The units themselves are old. Some cabinet doors fell off and our carpet could’ve justified replacement when we got here.
-Overall these are apartments for college students. Every once in a while, the pot smell is strong and the parties are loud (even in a pandemic ugh).
-The kitchens are small, closed off and not well-lit.

And here are the overwhelming pros:
-Aside from one previous manager who should remain nameless (but won’t, Brenda):"
The Highlands Apartments,"The Highlands are an awesome place to live. I've been living here since fall semester and I have enjoyed every minute. The maintenance workers and Dana are really friendly and helpful. Its pretty cool living next to the woods because not only is it a quiet environment but you'll see some cute little deer here and there. However I would not suggest living on the ground floor if you are afraid of little critters. I have literally seen every type of bug you can imagine in my apartment. There have been moths, camel crickets, and giant house spiders galore."
Medical Center Court Apartments,"This place breaths professionalism and kindness. My son and his girlfriend initially signed up for apartment reservation, however there were changes along the way, which were met with a promise from Medical Courts staff to work on making these changes. While we decided to go with a different McKinley property due to better proximity to the North Campus, our experience with Shivon and Zony was great, they were responsive, punctual, and curteous."
Medical Center Court Apartments,"The location is ideal for commuting to the hospital. The price is pretty typical for Ann Arbor. From what I know the prices have been consistent while surrounding neighborhoods have been rising or fluctuating, so that is a pro. The apartments are well-kept, with a responsive and kind management team. Shavon, the customer care associate, has been especially responsive to all of the questions and concerns I have had! They definitely make the concerns of their tenants a priority."
Medical Center Court Apartments,"Great location to med campus, easy walking to downtown, tons of parks around make this great spot! Otherwise, the apartments are on the older side, get pretty hot in the summer (ac isn't great) but maintenance has been positive! Great location for grad student / med students"
Medical Center Court Apartments,"Having been a resident for the past two years, I can confidently say that my experience has been suburb with Medical Center Court! Not only was it affordable on a graduate student budget, but also maintenance and the leasing office made me feel welcomed, safe, and they were all extremely responsive whenever I had a question or needed something fixed. I've never before experienced such great communication with an apartment community! Zontise and her entire team are a joy to work with and for a good chat :) Furthermore, the apartment is conveniently located by bus stops, the Huron River, Argo Park, and other trails for walking/running. It's a great place near the medical school and downtown, but far enough to not feel like you're living downtown and to get enough quietness. Overall, I'd absolutely recommend!!"
Medical Center Court Apartments,"I submitted a maintenance request for a broken kitchen cabinet, and Jason went above and beyond by replacing all the kitchen cabinets. The new cabinets look amazing and have completely transformed the look of my home. I'm extremely pleased with the results and the quality of work. Highly recommend!"
Charlton Apartments,"This complex gave me the worst experience when looking for an apartment: FIRST, they use an app called RentCafe that locks people out constantly and fails to make payments go through for tenants, which can hurt one's credit score. I called and emailed multiple times asking for help and they never followed through, only asking to try a different email that gets locked again. If management shows this little care for potential tenants, I can only imagine how currents tenants are being treated who can't pay their rent on time because of RentCafe.

SECOND, staff messed up more than once and failed to inform us of changes for meetings or availabilities when we were already driving over. Two times we were supposed to tour different apartments, only for the seller to say we couldn't see the place now and just pointed at stuff outside the building/room for us to view instead.

THIRD, staff there mixed up the prices and requirements for each apartment recommended. Including other details like balconies or patios. I asked if I could apply with a guarantor to meet the 3x monthly income for rent, which they said yes. But I suddenly get a call from them saying my guarantor can't be accepted now because they jacked up the requirement to 4x, something no one ever bothered to tell us was a thing they do. What makes that last point more irritating is the fact we already emailed our info after getting locked out, so their underwriter should have forewarned us at least a week ago how we didn't meet this new requirement.

All of this was irritating and irresponsible on Charlton's part. Their seller tried telling me I can wait until December now to build more income which is outrageous, because I already lost the possibility of moving into another complex this month due to poor management on their part. I would not risk buying their most luxurious apartment for the fairest price after all of this, the stress isn't worth it."
Charlton Apartments,"It was nice to live here. Had a CO leak the MGMT responded quickly; only bothered by how thin the hallway walls are.

Also just found out that the two of these buildings aren't even in the actual city of Ann Arbor? They're apparently on a Township Island belonging to Ann Arbor Twp. odd."
Charlton Apartments,"Really happy I moved into this apartment complex. Maintenance team is extremely nice, helpful, and always comes on time.
Management is also super friendly and helpful. Love that there is a dog park here and overall very happy with my experience living here."
Charlton Apartments,"Toured a unit under the impression that it would be available immediately. Then told me (after I paid $250 for the application) that I was wait listed until September! Do NOT rent here, Charlton is shady and deceptive, worst of a2 frankly"
Charlton Apartments,"I lived at the Charlton apartments for a year and it was a great experience overall. The neighborhood was nice, grocery shopping was very convenient (Kroger 5 min away), and whenever we had an issue maintenance was very quick. Communication with the leasing office was helpful and friendly. There was central ac and all of the appliances worked well. The only issue was heating, which was pretty inconsistent. We had the corner apartment with wall length windows, so the bedrooms got pretty cold in the winter compared to the living room. Having coin-operated rather than app-based laundry was a little annoying too. Otherwise a really nice place though, would recommend!"
Nob Hill Apartments,"I lived at Nob Hill for three years between 2022-2025 and really liked it, I would highly recommend it. It's affordable for its great location close to downtown Ann Arbor, and the management staff were responsive and professional in my experience. The only downside was that the apartments are quite old and thus some of the in-suited facilities like kitchen cabinets and closets are a bit rustic, albeit still works just fine."
Nob Hill Apartments,"I lived here for two years as a student at UM.

Pros are definitely the location, especially the price given the location— probably the most economical 1bd apartment in AA that’s still close to campus. Management and maintenance are very responsive. I’ve had day-of or day-after repairs on nearly every maintenance request here. The natural light was great too. My unit (I think it’s called the Delaware?) had north, south, and west-facing windows.

Primary con is just age. The AC is one of those three foot tall standalone units with a plastic duct venting to the outside. It’s electricity intensive (my energy bill during the summer went up like $40-50monthly) but not very effective. Setting the AC to 72 means that the living room will be about 78 and the rest of the apartment will be 80. I would definitely invest in a box fan for the bedroom. Another thing is that the appliances are pretty old. The oven is quite small, didn’t have a preheat alert, and the markings on the temperature knob were rubbed off so I was totally guessing at temps. The floorboards are creaky and you can sometimes hear your upstairs neighbors walking around.

Overall: well managed, great price for the location, lots of light, but the units themselves are pretty old and can get uncomfortable in the summer."
Nob Hill Apartments,"I lived in Nob Hill for 2 years, between 2023 and 2025. Overall, I really enjoyed my time here, and would highly recommend it for anybody looking for a place to live in Ann Arbor.

Pros:
-super close to downtown, can walk to Main Street in 5-10 minutes, campus in 15-20
-well priced for the area, you will not find a 1 bed for cheaper anywhere close to downtown
-apartments themselves are pretty and have charm, not just soulless boxes
-lots of natural light
-management is super helpful and is responsive to issues
-maintenance is amazing, issues were always solved same or next day
-actually recycles, most apartments don’t
-laundry facilities are nice
-pretty neighborhood, close to the stadium
-relatively quiet area

Cons:
-parking was sometimes an issue, especially during city/university events
-no a/c, you 100 percent NEED a portable AC in the summer- even with one, the heat can be unbearable in the summer
-most outlets are two pronged, which is pretty annoying sometimes
-kitchen size- the kitchens are really small

If I were to ever move back to Ann Arbor, I’d certainly live here again. It’s truly a great place to live."
Nob Hill Apartments,"Lived here for a year. One of my neighbors often banged things against the floor late at night, so powerful that the vibration passed all the way down through the wall and shook everything on my table. Wooden floors are squeaky, and soundproofing is not desirable — I could hear people talking or walking around. The ventilation seems shared vertically between units, and I often smelled cigarette smoke in my bathroom starting from this April. The AC only blows warm air, so it get really hot in the summer. Also, it’s very close to the train tracks, which will stop you from going to bed early.

No complaint with the price or location. Good choice for someone who doesn’t mind these things."
Nob Hill Apartments,"I have lived at Nob Hill since 2017! This is hands-down, the best apartment complex in Ann Arbor! The leasing office, especially Michaelle, our property manager, always go above and beyond for us! Our maintenance team is incredible! It's a lovely place to live!"
Spice Tree Apartments,"While move-in was fine back in '23, we've been having issues with maintenance not responding to requests we've put in over the last year and a half or so. Sometimes, they'd show up the next day. More often than not, not a peep from them for weeks and the issue doesn't get resolved until we try contacting someone at least three times.

Outside of our personal experiences, we happen to live in one of the buildings close to the main office. So at times, we see employee vehicles/maintenance golf carts sitting in the handicap parking spaces. Now I can't say for certain, but I'm pretty sure that's illegal even on their own property. It's there for the people who need it, not so their employees can park close to the office. On top of that, there's literally space beside the office building that looks like it's meant for the golf carts!

For the price we pay in rent every month, you'd expect better overall."
Spice Tree Apartments,"Living at Spicetree has been extremely disappointing because management has been unable or unwilling to resolve a serious marijuana smoke problem in my unit. For months, strong weed smoke has been coming into my apartment, affecting my health, sleep, and ability to enjoy my home. I followed the lease process, documented the issue, and sent detailed written complaints citing their own no‑marijuana and no‑smoking policies. Management admits someone is breaking the rules but says their ‘hands are tied’ because they haven’t identified the exact unit, and the only concrete solution they offered was for me to pay hundreds of dollars in transfer fees and accept a higher market rent to escape the situation.

Instead of meaningfully enforcing their own policies or offering a reasonable, fee‑free accommodation for a documented issue, they pushed the cost and burden onto me. It really feels like residents are expected to tolerate secondhand marijuana smoke or pay a premium to get away from it. I would not recommend this community to anyone who cares about air quality, quiet enjoyment, or responsive management."
Spice Tree Apartments,My move-in process was so smooth and well organized! I am truly grateful for my leasing agent Kerstin and her support during the whole process. I was looking for a quick move-in before the start of the semester and Kerstin made it possible! If you are looking for a well organized and truly caring management team I highly recommend Spice Tree Apartments.
Spice Tree Apartments,"I appreciate maintenance taking the time to remove the mold and debris from the bottom of the dishwasher; however, the filth was still present throughout the machine, in cracks, holes, and along the seals.  I purchased three different dishwasher cleaners to try and finish removing the black mold and gunk, but nothing has worked.  More and more black gunk comes out of the vent in the door and the sprayers.  The dishwasher is unsanitary and unsafe for use, so we hand-wash all dishes.

The dishwasher should have been examined and thoroughly cleaned between tenants.  I raised concerns about the state of the apartment when I moved in.  The apartment does not meet my living standards.  The dishwasher should be replaced.  The air conditioner should be repaired or replaced.  The bathroom fan should be replaced.  The rubber seal on the fridge should be replaced.  The fridge door handle is also cracked.  The cupboard under the sink should be sanitized and repaired.  The paint peeling in the shower is not an appropriate material for bathrooms and has to be cleaned out of the drain every week.  When we moved in the apartment was filthy.  A drawer in the kitchen was stuck open about 5 inches because the previous tenants had jammed Tupperware in it.  I had to clean food off the walls and floors.  There were wrappers and screws on the floor and the bedroom door could not be used because the hinges weren’t attached/it was hung incorrectly.  The flooring was cracked and sunken in.  The shower head was cracked and sprayed on the ceiling and over the shower curtain.  You cannot control the temperature of the shower.  The fan in the bathroom does not work properly.  Water runs down the walls and drips from the ceiling.  Either the apartment was not inspected, or the company is fine with the apartment being in such poor condition.  My electricity bill is $500/month because the air conditioner runs all day but the temperature of the apartment just keeps going up during the day.  It doesn’t function properly.  We couldn’t stay in the unit the first two nights because it was 80 degrees inside.  We left two messages for maintenance that weekend.  They never called back.  After a couple of weeks I called the managers office to complain and they opened a maintenance ticket and had someone come out, but they only fixed 1/4 of the issues and said they would talk to their supervisor about the rest.  That was a month ago.

Edit: 9/16 - I am editing this to add that the apartment complex replied to this review stating they addressed the issues and appreciate the opportunity to make things right.  This is a lie.  No one spoke to me or has been in my apartment since they said they would talk to their supervisor.  They left me a voicemail.  I called back after hours and left a voicemail.  No one ever called back.

Also, for the last month there has been food or vomit splattered up the stairs and ground into the carpet.  The cleaners have come to vacuum at least twice, but nothing has been done to actually clean the carpet.  This place is disgusting."
Spice Tree Apartments,I have a short lease signed during the summer. I worked with James and he is really helpful with guiding me through everything. Spicetree apartment a nice and quiet apartment. Enjoyed my stay here!
Ann Arbor Apartments managed by CMB,"I love everything about living in an apartment managed by CMB. The staff are so friendly and helpful, especially Savannah. She really helped my spouse and I choose a place to live with her friendly demeanor.

I enjoy the maintenance staff who seem to be over doing a little bit of something all the time. Cleaning up the ground, doing repairs, maintenance on the building or on a unit… they do it all and always with a quickness to it. I really enjoy being here so far and only foresee continuing to be."
Ann Arbor Apartments managed by CMB,"Recently moved in to one of Ann Arbor Apartments buildings managed by CMB, and it's been one of the most pleasurable moving experiences I've had through my decade living in Ann Arbor. Savannah and everyone I interact with are always so kind and wonderful and open to answering any questions."
Ann Arbor Apartments managed by CMB,"Highly recommend Ann Arbor Apartments! The apartment I lived in over the course of my senior year at the UM was wonderful. The AAA staff is really friendly and understanding. The communication with the staff was great, payments were easy to handle. I never had a single issue during my stay. I am really satisfied and happy with my choice of AAA! It was a pleasure to work with them!"
Ann Arbor Apartments managed by CMB,"The team and management practices at Ann Arbor Apartments made renewing our lease a no brainer. Truly the best experience from touring all the way to the day-to-day living in a beautiful apartment. Maintenance is timely, efficient, and caring. No complaints.

I have had many less than ideal landlords — CMB /  Ann Arbor Apartments has been a very refreshing change. A very special shout out to Savannah, Kay, and Jenny. Keep up the good work, we see it and feel it!"
Ann Arbor Apartments managed by CMB,"Very good place, my apartments are older, but that's reflected by the price. What helps is the management understands this and does everything to make things comfortable. They would repair maintenance request within 1-2 business days, and things would often be fixed. Very good landlord, great staff"
Oakcliff Apartments,"Excellent Place for living in Ann Arbor!!! I have lived at OakCliff for 3 years. The location, community, safety and service are perfect! I have so many good memories here. Kendra, Hati, Dan are very nice! If you need any help, they will reply to your message/email very quickly! If you have a car, the private garage is also a great plus (cool in summer, warm in winter)! They clean the snow from the road before you go to work in the morning. By the way, moving in and out was also very smooth. I have recommended this place to many friends."
Oakcliff Apartments,"Moved into Oakcliff recently, and I have had a very positive experience thus far. Would definitely recommend Oakcliff to others. Looking forward to living here.

- Matthew from leasing team coordinated my application and helped me view available units/floorplans despite me not being able to visit Ann Arbor for a tour. Very smooth process overall with seeing videos of available units, application, and preparation for move-in.

- Move-in itself was very easy. I really appreciate the private garage which made it easy to unload UHaul. Tons of extra storage space in the garage which is great.

- I had a couple of minor maintenance requests on move-in, and Justin/Amanda were great in helping resolve these. They worked quickly to help me get these fixed and communicated their progress to me via the resident app.

- community amenities are a huge perk. I really appreciate the business center (with free printing!), nice clubhouse spaces, and pool/hot tub.

- close to hospital and lots of food options. Kroger nearby is nice. Overall quieter community than other areas I’ve lived in previously."
Oakcliff Apartments,"I just moved to Oakcliff Apartments and I needed some repairs done from the previous tenant. The maintenance team Justin and Amanda have been incredible! They are very speedy, communicative, friendly, and efficient. The two of them are confident in their skills and extremely courteous of your belongings and keeping your apartment clean. They always say hello to me while I am walking around the compound and they have demonstrated hard work ethic and drive! Lucky to have a superb maintenance team at my new place!"
Oakcliff Apartments,"STAT AWAY FROM APT#2427. I lived in #2427 for a year and half with my wife, but total experience was terrible. When I first moved in, I really liked  this place because it was very quiet and surrounded by beautiful nature. After moving-in, I noticed generous amount of noise coming from the ceiling. That was foot step noise from the neighbor in the upstairs. It was over the acceptance level and even at 1 or 2 am sometimes. My wife and I woke up due to the noise. This noise was not every day thing, so we tried to bear it but it started to affect our lives and I just couldn’t stand seeing my wife feeling stressed. Few days later, the noise happened again, so I went and spoke to her that the issue happened again. She said she is going to send an email to the neighbor in the upstairs that she needs to be mindful in the late night(after 10pm). However, the email didn’t really work for the neighbor. I realized that the ceiling is thin and poorly sound-proofed. I knew that I will be living here for a year and half so we didn’t want to hassle for moving out and finding the new place because I didn’t do anything wrong. When I realized that the ceiling is poor, I told her that you have to do something to resolve this issue. They didn’t take it seriously and what they told me was that they warned the neighbors. After the new manager is assigned to Oak cliff, I reached out to the new manager to explain the situation and she was not supportive AT ALL. One day, the neighbor in the upstairs had a party in the late night and of course, I could hear so many noises. So I emailed her that not only me but also my wife is also suffering from the noise. What she replied to me was this. “XXXX informed me that your wife was making the complaint about the noise. Since your wife is not on the lease technically, she is not a resident here and I can't go by the complaint that she is making because she is not supposed to be living in the apartment without being on the lease. In that regard, I understand that you will be moving out in December, but it is technically a violation of your lease to have someone living in your home without them being on the lease.” I was speechless and pissed off with this message. I have mentioned multiple times that I have my wife living in the same apartment together, but no one in the office ever mentioned anything or cared. And all of sudden, the manager said this to me. It has nothing to do with the noise issue. I really hated that she mocked me for something while putting her own issue aside. Very disrespectful to me and my wife. Whenever I hear similar noises, I always remember this experience and my chest feels squeezed. It’s just so sad that my life experience in Michigan could have been much better, but due to the poorly soundproofed apartment and cold-blooded respond from the manager, it left some bitter memory in my mind. In conclusion, if you are going to live in 2nd floor or don’t get the noise issue, you are going to love it. Nice residents, clean club house and cozy place. And also, assistants in the office are all very nice and kind. Don’t get me wrong. I would have loved the apartment if there was no noise issue.  just stay away from #2427 and possibly all the residents located in the first floor. I will attache the video of the actual noise from the upstairs. No one needs to have a same experience that I had. I hope Oakcliff sees this one day and realize how terrible it was and does something to resolve the issue to make it perfect place."
Oakcliff Apartments,"I’ve been a resident at Oakcliff for nearly two years, and I have enjoyed being part of the community. The maintenance team has consistently been attentive and accommodating, always mindful of the busy schedules of the residents.

I recently relocated to a different unit within Oakcliff and have had several interactions with the maintenance crew due to a few broken appliances and minor work orders. As I have a small dog and a full-time job, coordinating a time during working hours to be home for repairs can be challenging. However, the maintenance team has been extremely helpful and efficient, ensuring timely repairs despite the scheduling difficulties.

Both Justin and Amanda have been exceptional in managing these situations and turning potentially frustrating experiences into smooth resolutions.

It appears that there is a high turnover rate among the leasing office staff, which often results in short staffing. This may contribute to delayed responses and instances where incorrect information is provided to residents. While I understand staffing challenges, there is always room for improvement in communication. As the leasing office staff plays a key role in sales and customer service, I hope they recognize that their interactions with residents directly reflect the property’s reputation.

I can also confirm that the noise complaint mentioned prior to this review is valid. I share the same concerns as previous tenant and have had a similar experience. As a result, I took the initiative to address the issue directly with my upstairs neighbor, providing furniture pads and sound-dampening slippers in an effort to reduce the noise."
The George Ann Arbor,"We lived in this place for two years, and our experience with management was very disappointing. They required a 60-day notice to move out, which is unusually strict compared to other places I’ve rented. Even though we told them well in advance that we were leaving, we responded in writing through the electronic form they sent asking if we wanted to renew or not, clearly indicating we did not want to renew. Despite this, they didn’t send us the official notice form until there were fewer than 60 days remaining. Once we received that form, we promptly filled it out and returned it.

Despite this, they claimed we had given insufficient notice and charged us for an entire extra month of rent, even though our lease only ran 7 days into that month. On top of that, they withheld our entire security deposit without any clear explanation beyond saying it was used to cover the extra month, even though we were already charged separately for it.

We emailed them and called multiple times on different days from different phones trying to resolve the issue, but they were very slow to respond and ultimately offered no solution. We ended up having to pay everything they demanded.

Also be aware that they have a policy where you are only allowed to pay rent on the first day of the month, and if you forget, they charge you $100 per day for each day it’s late. I feel this is extremely strict and unreasonable—they don’t give you any grace period or payment window. I’ve never encountered anything like that in other places I’ve rented.

In every other apartment I’ve lived in, simply confirming the lease-end date was enough notice, and I always received my full deposit back. This has been my worst rental experience."
The George Ann Arbor,"I recently moved into The George, and the transition has been incredibly smooth. The amenities are top-notch, providing a high level of convenience, cleanliness, and security. After touring many apartment complexes, I found The George to be the best by far. The staff is friendly and responsive, and the community atmosphere is welcoming. I highly recommend The George to anyone looking for a great place to live."
The George Ann Arbor,"This is an incredible place to live! The maintenance and management teams are top-notch—always friendly, professional, and consistently go above and beyond. My dog absolutely loved it too, especially with all the treats she received at the leasing office. Overall, my experience was exceptional, and I highly recommend it!"
The George Ann Arbor,RARELY reply emails and phone calls. RARELY!!!!!! You never know what they are doing all day in the office……. I would go to church to thank God if they answer any emails or phone calls faster. Moody people should not choose her it will blow your mind up.
The George Ann Arbor,"I have been living in The George for over 2 years, but due to several critical issues, I am planning to relocate to a new apartment in Northern Ann Arbor.

CONS: One major drawback is the excessive noise from the floors. The apartment lacks sound-absorbing flooring, making it very noisy whenever neighbors walk, jump, or talk. This issue contrasts with other new apartments in North Ann Arbor that have sound-absorbing wood floors, as reported by my friends. What's worse, the Community Manager, who oversees the entire apartment complex, has not responded to my emails for several months. This lack of communication and huge noise have significantly disrupted my sleep and work routine, so I spend more time at my partner’s apartment. The manager only seemed prompt in responding to emails regarding lease renewals, neglecting other resident concerns.

Additionally, the area experienced very frequent power outages last winter (5-6 times), ranging from 2 to 4 days per outage, which is uncommon compared to other areas where my friends live, where power outages occurred only once or twice. I had to throw away all foods, drove through snow blizzard/snow storms (Very dangerous), and stayed in my partner’s apartment.

Minor issues include the shower booth floor being difficult to clean leading to quick mold buildup, noisy air conditioning units, and numerous stains in the hallways.

PROS: The maintenance staff and janitors are friendly and helpful. The maintenance team went above and beyond to assist me when I had issues with my air conditioner, unlike the community manager. The apartment complex features a nice pool and ample parking spaces. Being relatively new, it also includes in-unit washer/dryer and basic appliances."
The Courtyards Student Apartments,"I coming onto a year and a half of staying in the courtyards and I can say that its been a pleasant experience for the most part.

Units are fully furnished, having my own bed and bath is amazing, walls are thin so sound easily passes through, you get your own washer and dryer and a fully done up kitchen so amazing overall

Location wise its the best you'll get (on north campus) - NCRB next to you, Bursley in front if you want a meal plan, football pitch on the side for outdoor runners and tons of food spots behind as well as bus stops for both Bursley baits (S side) in front and the ride for Ann Arbor in the back (N side)

I do believe that though stated in the lease there are often times extra fees that one wouldn't expect such as the recurring annual community fee or annual electricity startup fee though I have already been living here or the high cost of key replacement and they aren't necessarily willing to work with you/are extremely strict with their rules even for special circumstances. Outside that they host cool events (Ive honestly not been to many but its great to know they do) and even have a game room which I like to go hang out in with friends to play billiards or watch a game on the huge tv.

Utilities(elec+water) are also a little high but not unmanageable at about 40-50USD per person per month for a 3bed3bath apt

Outside that the support team (via the app) for any issues regarding the apartment such as leaks, damage etc are absolutely on point and very friendly as well as timely.

In summation. If asked whether I'd like to live here again given the choice - yes I would"
The Courtyards Student Apartments,"Great apartment! I lived here for several months and felt really welcomed. There a lot of events here, like movies night and pop corn events. It felt like this is my own home! Strong sense of belongings. Also, the office team and maintenance team are friendly and helpful. Really enjoy the time here!"
The Courtyards Student Apartments,"The Courtyards is definitely a nice apartment building if you like convenience for a higher price. All apartments are fully furnished (my favorite is the in-house washer/dryer, no more paying for washing my clothes!!) and the maintenance on the building/apartments is extremely well done. When there’s a problem it usually took maybe 1 day at most for someone to come look at the apartment. And the staff are very receptive to questions/emails (I locked myself out at very odd times and they helped me out a lot) . I would totally recommend."
The Courtyards Student Apartments,"They kicked my son out of his apartment on one days notice for some apparent structural issue, an issue that they did not describe to us.  When he returned, there were temporary support beams in the living room which apparently were going to stay there all year.  It is not clear why they are there.  It is impossible to reach them -- their AI phone service routinely hangs up on you.  I have notified the City of Ann Arbor building inspector because I have not gotten answers."
The Courtyards Student Apartments,"Honestly love living at The Courtyards. The place is super convenient for North Campus, clean, and has everything you need… nice study areas, gym, and hangout spots. Cal is a really good guy, super easy to talk to, and actually makes things run smoothly. You can tell he cares about helping residents out. Overall, solid place to live and great experience so far."
Traver Heights Apartments,"The sound insulation in this apartment is extremely poor. Even normal walking from the second floor is unbearably loud on the first floor, and the creaking from the old wooden structure makes it very difficult to rest. Management has offered no solutions to address this issue — unless their only idea is to somehow stop your upstairs neighbors from walking. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone."
Traver Heights Apartments,"I’ve had a great experience living at Traver Heights. The property manager, Joe, has been exceptional—attentive, responsive, and proactive. When my heater stopped working, he had it replaced within a few hours, ensuring minimal disruption. He also arranged for a new dryer when the old one malfunctioned, making sure everything was handled smoothly.

The community is well-maintained, clean, and friendly, creating a comfortable living environment. I appreciate the management’s commitment to keeping this a great place to live. Highly recommend Traver Heights!"
Traver Heights Apartments,"I rented a 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment from Traver Heights for 1.5 years.  It proved to be a great fit for me.  The staff and residents are all very nice and considerate.  The apartment and grounds are clean and well maintained.  The couple of times I needed to submit a service request, the concern was addressed effectively and efficiently.  The first floor apartment stayed amazingly cool in the summer and the available AC rarely kicking on.  They were extraordinarily helpful when I was getting ready to vacate.  They extended my lease by 1 month, which provided me with the necessary time to pack and move my belongings.  In contrast, other apartments would have required me to either pay double rent for that 1 month or sign a new lease and forfeit the subsequent lease-breakage fee.  If I needed to lease an apartment again in the A2 area, 100% Traver Heights would be my go to."
Traver Heights Apartments,"The apartment complex is located in a quiet and nice neighborhood, within walking distance of the elementary school and grocery stores. The management team, especially Jason, is very responsive in dealing with our lease takeover arrangements."
Traver Heights Apartments,"Very helpful and assertive staff, maintenance issues fixed and they were very prompt and very polite."
Ann Arbor Woods,"Safe, clean & affordable. I loved living at A2 Woods for the past two years. Both the management and maintenance staff were professional, efficient and very respectful. I found it easy to communicate my needs and the responses were immediate, even for low priority issues. I especially loved the easy walks into town, near by park, community pool, library and Trader Joes. Great quality of life!"
Ann Arbor Woods,"i’d recommend sparing yourself the trouble. the office managers are rude and off putting. You’ll call and they either ignore you and don’t answer, or they answer and act like you’re the biggest inconvenience for asking them to do their job. you pay for services like a trash fee, but nobody comes to pick it up for weeks on end. they’ll tack on late fees. they’ll tell you you can’t do something (like smoke) but then smoke outside the office with no signage saying you can’t smoke mind u, (which is necessary btw), nor do they provide a place to smoke for you? they suggest u smoke in your car…so.

the community and location is great but the hassle of how terrible you get treated by the office isn’t worth it. the community even started a thread of complaints for the office which they tried to shut down. you might have a nice tour guide, but once you sign that lease, they immediately stop being nice. all an act. can’t wait to move out."
Ann Arbor Woods,"Such a lovely property with so many beautiful, mature trees. I truly enjoy the view of the courtyard from my apartment. It’s just lovely. The maintenance team is always kind and quick to help. Jamie and Justin in the office have been absolutely wonderful. They are so patient and helpful whenever I have had questions about the resident portal or anything else. I really appreciate them."
Ann Arbor Woods,"I lived in Ann Arbor Woods for two years, and it was the best apartment I lived in while in Ann Arbor. The staff went above and beyond to ensure anything I needed was taken care of ASAP (often the same day or the day after I reached out!). Even more, I could always email (with same day responses) or walk over to the main office for any questions I may have had.

I cannot recommend this place enough - especially to any new graduate students! How do you beat living behind Trader Joe's, by a nice park, plenty of bus stops, and a nice walk to York?"
Ann Arbor Woods,"The location of the apartment and the easy access to Trader Joe's was a great plus point the apartment, but everything concerning the actual management was a massive negative, and contributed to the reason I left after 4 years of living here

- The management (i.e. Jamie and later Justin) were very unhelpful whenever it was time to renew the lease for another year. In both 2022 and 2024, the lease renewal process was extremely stressful because they dragged their feet on actually sending the renewed lease contract, and were unresponsive via email or phone. In both the instances, me (and the next resident after I left) received the renewed lease contract well after the original lease had already expired.
- The management was also very unhelpful with any actual maintenance issues: my apartment had a mouse problem in December 2022, and despite several promises by management to send pest control, no one every showed up. Finally, I had to set traps myself, and monitor the situation for several weeks. This is despite the management charging a pest control fee. It's unclear what that fee was actually paying for.
- Finally, since I left, the other tenants in the apartment complex have been trying to form a tenants union, since they can get better responses to issues like the above as a collective unit rather than individual tenants. However, the management has refused to engage, and illegally threatened one of the organizers of the union with eviction, despite the fact that it is perfectly legal in Michigan to form tenants association.

I would not recommend living here, even though being close to Trader Joe's is a really nice perk: it is not worth the low quality of living otherwise."
Shoreview Apartments,"After completing my 9 month lease at Shoreview I can confidently recommend living here to anyone. Jenna, at the office, is absolutely fantastic. Very prompt, thorough and kind. The staff is consistently putting together free events for tenants and any maintenance issues are handled swiftly.

The surrounding area, parking lots, and buildings felt so incredibly safe, I never worried about my packages being stolen, car being broken into or my personal safety.

The best part of Shoreview is that you're treated like a person. With each situation that pops up the staff considers all of the factors and personalized the response and solutions.

I'd absolutely recommend making Shoreview your next home!"
Shoreview Apartments,Maintenance has always been very timely after I put in a request. They recently came to do a preventive maintenance inspection in preparation for the winter and the maintenance guy was very mindful about taking his shoes off after entering and cleaning up any messes made during repairs. I really appreciated it!
Shoreview Apartments,"There are many things that I love about Shoreview - the location, for one, is wonderful, and the common areas are well maintained. I do not usually mind that there are frequent maintenance issues  (e.g. in winter the heat often has problems due to the age of the pipes) because the maintenance team is typically very responsive, friendly, and helpful  - which I appreciate, thank you!

But I have been having issues getting my dishwasher fixed since December and it is now March...
I have put in multiple maintenance requests about this. After initial attempts to fix the problem did not succeed, I submitted another maintenance request on February 2nd. The maintenance log (incorrectly) lists this problem as being fixed on February 13th. I was out of town at this time and when I returned on Feb 22nd, the dishwasher was still not working properly.  I submitted another maintenance request that day informing Shoreview of this. The maintenance log says that the work was ""completed"" today (March 7th), yet nobody contacted me or came to fix the dishwasher today. I am leaving this review because (1) it seems disingenuous to update the issue as ""completed on  March 7th"" when nothing was done today and the dishwasher is still dysfunctional, and (2) it shouldn't take nearly three months to fix a dishwasher...

[A photo of the maintenance log for this issue is attached for reference.]

Update:
03/23/24
1. The owner's response suggests that the problem related to not using the dishwasher correctly, which was not the case. After posting my review, the broken dishwasher was acknowledged and I was told that a replacement would be ordered.
2. Two weeks later, the moldy and rusty replacement has been installed (see additional attached photos)."
Shoreview Apartments,I've been living here for 3 years and the leasing office (Jenna & Kristen) always provide exception and friendly service. The maintenance team does similarly exceptional work and I'm always happy to great them and have pleasant chats around the property.
Shoreview Apartments,"We lived at this residence for 2 years and had a good experience overall. We had quite a few small maintenance issues over our time at Shoreview, but Justin and the gang were always quick to respond to our requests. Our biggest complaint is the laundry setup...the machines are small, expensive, and are constantly out of order; unfortunately they are outsourced to a separate company so they are not the maintenance team's issue.

Very happy we spent our time in Ann Arbor here, right next to the Huron River, utilizing the pool, adequate parking, and basement storage unit provided."
Sterling Arbor Blu,"I really enjoyed my time living here. The units themselves were nice and well taken care of. The prices are what they are but they were all inclusive of utilities and internet which does add some value. The staff were friendly and did their best to ensure a high quality resident experience.

Having lived here and another similar building, the issues Arbor Blu faces are the same issues other buildings in the area experience as well. The only unique issue Arbor Blu has is Garage Bar, the outdoor bar occupying the first level of the building. Especially over the summer, it got loud in our unit, even on the 11th floor. I would have liked the management company to set policies to keep the noise at a lower level and required it to stop at a certain hour as well.

My largest grievance was the virtual doorman, Butterfly. In my opinion, having the system quite literally opened the door for widespread abuse and safety concerns. It made no sense to allow people to open the door for others while the resident wasn’t home, could create codes that can be used anytime without oversight, etc. The significantly decreased level of safety was not worth the minimal convenience. I lived there both before and after its installation and preferred living without it. Regrettably this technology did seem to be a “hot trend” in the area so other buildings have been building it as well.

Overall a solid choice for housing with management company that was pleasurable to do business with.

Not directly Arbor Blu, but if you need to park a car I would recommend looking at other buildings. The Ann Arbor garage they offer spots with sometimes had waits to leave, had limited spaces and was just a small headache."
Sterling Arbor Blu,"PLEASE READ BEFORE CONSIDERING LIVING HERE

I was never one to write harsh reviews, but after living here for just a couple of months, I was forced to. Please read all of this before even thinking about signing a lease. For legal purposes, I am using an alias.

I pay over $2,100 a month to live here, and honestly this place is light years behind every other apartment in Ann Arbor. The location is great, but that’s where the positives stop. Everything else feels like a bad joke for the price.

The gym is a complete joke. There is one machine and dumbbells that only go up to 50 pounds. I have seen motels with better gyms. For $2,000 a month, I shouldn’t have to walk somewhere else just to get a real workout.

Cooking here is a nightmare. If you make literally anything, the smell spreads through the entire hallway. Friends constantly ask why it reeks every time they visit, and it’s because the ventilation is absolutely horrible. I shouldn’t have to worry about my dinner smell reaching the end of the hall.

The WiFi is unusable. It lags constantly, so I don’t even bother with it anymore. I use my own data instead. If I try to play Xbox online, I lag out of every single game.

Noise control is non existent. You can talk at a normal volume and be heard down the hall. There is zero privacy in these apartments.

The washer and dryer are terrible. Every load comes out covered in lint no matter how much you clean the filter. I know multiple people in Arbor Blu with the same problem. Towels and clothes come out ruined because the dryers are old and never maintained.

The hallways always smell because of poor airflow. One time it smelled like fish for an entire day because someone down the hall cooked something.

The furniture is cheap and uncomfortable. The couch is unbearable, and they didn’t even give us the corner chair that was shown in the floor plan when we moved in.

The rooftop closes at 10 p.m., which is ridiculous for a “luxury” apartment. No other building in Ann Arbor does that. The only “luxury” part of this place is the location, and that is not worth $2,100 a month.

To make things worse, this building is right above Garage Bar, and from Thursday through Saturday you will hear music blasting until 2 a.m. It doesn’t matter what floor you live on. Sleep is not an option on weekends.

And don’t even get me started on the package room. They just throw packages into piles and hope you find yours. I have lost three packages already, and I’m not the only one. There are plenty of reviews saying the same thing.

I genuinely don’t understand how this place has good reviews. I have already signed a lease at Vic Village South. It’s newer, cleaner, quieter, and somehow cheaper.

If you have a budget around $2,000 a month, do yourself a favor and live anywhere else. I would walk three miles before ever resigning here again.

The employees here are great, however, and I have nothing bad to say about them."
Sterling Arbor Blu,"My son moved into Arbor Blu this week. James Yancy, the office attendant, was friendly, conversational and knowledgeable. James made us feel welcome and was able to answer all of our questions. He is definitely an asset to the Sterling Arbor Blu Company."
Sterling Arbor Blu,"I have lived at Arbor Blu for two years and I have enjoyed every moment of it.  The rooftop lounge is great for studying during the day and having friends come hang out at night.  Downstairs, the official study lounge has been a lifesaver for getting homework done, especially in bad weather when walking to the library isn't ideal.  The study lounge is also great because it has a printer, resident computers, AND a coffee machine with Starbucks coffee.  (It's amazing to just be able to walk downstairs and get a free coffee in the morning, let me tell you that.) However, my favorite part about living here is my apartment.  Coming from the dorms, I have loved having a washer and dryer inside my apartment with me (no more trudging up and down flights of stairs with a heavy laundry basket!).  The kitchen is also phenomenal.  I love to cook and bake, and the counter space and dual-compartment sink makes prepping and cleanup easy.  The floors in the kitchen, living room, and bathrooms are a breeze to clean as well.  The apartments come fully furnished (even with a TV that lets you easily connect your Netflix account!) and the wifi is reliable and speedy.  Even though the rooms in my particular unit are relatively small, the beds are lifted high enough to make it easy to store items underneath and a little bit of organization really makes the most of the space! Everyone, from the maintenance crew to the office staff, is very kind and helpful here.  They also organize fun events and hand out food on special occasions!   I would recommend living here to anyone who's considering it."
Sterling Arbor Blu,"Arbor Blu is truly amazing, the staff is so helpful (shoutout James!) and truly cares about their residents. The amenities are always wonderfully clean and they give out free cookies and other treats throughout the year! This apartment has the best location and I highly recommend!"
Villas at Northstar,"Had a pleasant experience staying there.

The facilities were well maintained, including the gym and swimming pool.

The maintenance workers were very efficient and prompt in their work. Whenever it snowed at night, the snow along the walkway and roads were cleared before 8am. And maintenance workers visit the house within the same day whenever I had a maintenance request.

The leasing office is also very welcoming, with free board games and drinks.

Overall, a quiet and pleasant place to live."
Villas at Northstar,"Had to change my review as I am having the worst experience in getting my security deposit back. I have moved out in May 2024 but to date (4months) they have not sent me the cheque!

The situation started when the leasing office had sent the cheque to the wrong location. Spoke to their assistant manager and manager subsequently. Both promised to resend the cheque. Unfortunately, to date, I have not received my deposit. Correspondence with the leasing office has been difficult and frustrating, especially if you are out of the country Been trying to seek clarification on the situation but got ‘ghosted’ most of the time.

Existing resident do take great caution when asking your deposit back."
Villas at Northstar,"Beware!!! They charge a $375 application/admin fee that may or may not be refundable depending on the day, apparently,  according to Kyle and Heather at the corporate office, Greystar. They might also charge you for an extra day after you move out unless YOU can prove otherwise. Can’t imagine how many people have fallen victim to these scammers. Extremely unprofessional. Having said that, the staff at the actual Villa office is nice.  Finally, be sure to see the apartment you’re going to get ahead of time as they certainly don’t all look anything close to their glossy brochure.  I think the stove in one apartment might have been built in the 1970’s?? 😳"
Villas at Northstar,"Poorly maintained. Maintenance was in and out of my apartment often with no notice or explanation as to why maintenance staff were in my home.  Had to file a police report and install a camera for the no notice, illegal, visits.

Manager attempted, and failed, to ding my credit report claiming I never returned the keys with a “key fee”.  Ridiculous because I had a confirmation email stating the keys were returned.

Exterior panels on building missing.  Emailed manager many times, manager states “unable to get anyone out.”  Really?  The missing panels have been like that for years.  See pictures attached.

Snow removal takes days, and no salt applied resulting in ice sheets"
Villas at Northstar,"Special Kudos to Neil, Gino and maintenance team! Outstanding work!
On a hot and humid summer day my AC stopped working. Called maintenance in evening hours and Neil was shortly at my apartment. After brief inspection - turns out the AC compressor had to be replaced which is no easy or fast task since the AC unit is quite heavy.
Neil called in support and Gino was at my place within 30min.
Together Neil and Gino did an outstanding job to fix the AC - all while during evening hours!
Delighted with the support and competence of Neil and Gino!
my AC is back ON and nicely cooling my apartment during these hot summer days."
Parc Pointe Apartments,"Apparently this community lets anyone park here on weekends for free — even if you’re not a resident. No penalties, no towing, nothing. And the covered spots keep your car nice and dry from the snow. Everyone, feel free to come try it out!"
Parc Pointe Apartments,"I lived there for a year and it was great! The house was a bit old for sure but it’s pretty good price in Ann Arbor, and the leasing office staff is always very helpful and friendly. Would totally recommend."
Parc Pointe Apartments,"This is a very comfortable community, although it has been built for a long time and is well maintained. The environment is quiet and hygienic, and it is very close to the University of Michigan. It is suitable for families studying abroad."
Parc Pointe Apartments,"Best place in Ann Arbor. 5 mins from downtown, so many restaurants & shops within a 2 minute walk. And the best part is SO MANY NATURE TRAILS! Leading right to the golf course! The management is sooo sweet to me I love them and they always fix my problems within MINUTES! So happy and grateful to the ladies, my amazing neighbors and everyone in this community. They're all so kind, mindful, and accepting or a weirdo neighbor like me 🥰😂 p.s the giant balcony and real log fireplaces are something I am gonna miss dearly.

I will forever be grateful to the maintenance guy Julian for always being so friendly and even fixing things I didn't ask him too"
Parc Pointe Apartments,"I have been living here for the past 6 months and my experience is good so far, the construction is a little old but highly maintained. The service is fast as once our heater was not working in the morning and they fixed it in the afternoon."
Huron Towers Apartments,"Huron Towers definitely deserves to be above a 3.9 average star rating! Writing this review to help with that.

I lived in Huron Towers for a year and a half (late 2022 to mid-2024) and really enjoyed my time there. The building feels so strong; while not the most aesthetically appealing to some, I liked the concrete - it helped keep things quieter and I personally like older stuff, it just feels better built. I heard the people on the sides of me sometimes and the person above me maybe twice? Generally though, it was fairly quiet. Maybe I just had quiet neighbors.

The balconies are so big and awesome. I had a full-size hammock on mine plus a high-top table (and I was in a studio). They're wrap around style - so the bigger your apt the bigger your balcony. Now I did have some partitions on mine, which were grandfathered in from the previous renter...I don't think you're allowed to do that anymore...that probably added to some of the awesomeness for me personally - but either way, you can still enjoy the balcony if you choose to.

Being on the river and hugging the arboretum was so nice; really felt calm and like home. There's also a lovely vegan restaurant in the bottom of B building. The pool on the river is nice too; it feels kind of like a resort in the summer! Also, the building is right on the B2B trail!

Maintenance is great and so is management. They will take care of you - just be nice!

As for cons, really all I can think of is that I felt like we lost power more than other residences I've lived in. One time it was out for like 4 or 5 days, I think. Could have just been a bad year, not sure. Oh, also it's not really walking distance to downtown - but it is biking distance. It took me ~15 min on a bike. They did upgrades on the elevators while I was there, so you’re all good with that. As for price, I think it’s very competitive for Ann Arbor - and if you value nature, I really think it’s one of the best apartment complexes in AA for that.

And lastly, it depends on what unit you get, but some of them have extraordinary views - I was obsessed with mine! It was like a live painting that changed daily with loads of people/ activity watching. Here are some of my fav photos - I took them so often because it was so pretty!!!

Happy apt hunting."
Huron Towers Apartments,"The maintenance is very responsive to your needs--when I had issues, they were addressed VERY quickly. This is huge.
I like the high rise style and that the buildings, though much older  than some other ones in Ann Arbor, are well maintained.  The team here is extremely proactive about any issues that arise and those are addressed efficiently.

Love the big balconies.
Love that it's on direct bus line
All the staff here take pride in their work.

Good people-they take care of the humans who live here! It's a good place and a good community.

The amenities are good too-there is something for everyone."
Huron Towers Apartments,"I LOVE Jurom Towers-I've lived here since 1984, first with my beloved Mom and then on my own on 705B! My apartment was recently removed and is absolutely GORGEOUS with the track lighting in the kitchen and the lovely new carpeting and flooring. I love being on the bus line and the staff are wonderful! A winner!!!!"
Huron Towers Apartments,"Huron Towers has been my home for past 7 years and I love living here. The management are great and super helpful. The apartment is close to the university and downtown with good access to public transport. My apartment is spacious, comfortable and i get help whenever needed from the maintenance staff. Living here is great!"
Huron Towers Apartments,This is the best apartment complex in ann arbor I’ve seen yet. I looked for an apartment complex for months and everyone recommended me to Huron Towers. I’ve seen them literally switching out the carpets between move-ins. The place is well up-kept with regular maintenance and much much cheaper than other apartment complexes (with wallpaper literally tearing down). There’s even a free gym and pool (in the summer). The location is convenient as it’s a 5 minute walk from a bus station between north and central campus (where all the busses pass by and stop). There’s also not one but two (one of them vegan) restaurants literally downstairs in the same building. And even a convenience store and hair salon to boot. There’s literally no better apartment for price.
Arbor Haus Apartments,"Deena is an amazing property manager.  You can tell she truly loves what she does. She went above and beyond to help us move in smoothly.  She is proactive in getting what  needs to be done completed, detail oriented, very responsive, and a pleasure to know. Not to mention she is fun! Thank you for making this move an easy one."
Arbor Haus Apartments,"Cons: There is no central A/C for these apartments. There is one wall mounted unit in the living room. In the summer, the bedroom gets very hot making it unsleepable and the wall mounted unit in the living room can’t keep up or blow enough cold air to properly cool the apartment. No ceiling fans to help. The wall mounted unit is also super loud and runs up your electric bill

The “renovations” are substandard. Expired paint was used on the accent wall in the living room. It was giving off a foul odor. Property manager said she didn’t smell anything despite the obvious odor. The moment the maintenance worker showed up, immediately confirmed it was expired paint that was used. The vinyl floor is very cheap and wears, scratches, and breaks easily. Fixtures were falling apart. The bedroom door fell off its hinges, towel rack and toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom fell off the wall, plumbing under the kitchen sink came apart, electrical problems causing outlets to malfunction and not work, and more

Basement communal laundry machines are small, old, and expensive

Pros: Location is good and the rent is on the lower end, which is what attracts people here. The property manager is nice and tries to help."
Arbor Haus Apartments,"love Arbor House—it’s a beautiful and welcoming complex. The staff are very cooperative and kind, especially Tina. She is a wonderful person who genuinely cares about us and our children. We often have parties and activities here, which bring the community together. It’s truly an amazing place to live."
Arbor Haus Apartments,"I’ve been living here since august, at first it was horrible. There were roaches, thing in the apartment kept breaking and it would be hard to get ahold of someone. But around January this place started to turn around. The new manager Jeremy started by making this place pet friendly. At first it was not and me and my partner had the only dog. He than began answering all call in a timely manner. He would speak to the residents and fixing problems our building had. They started regularly spraying and by march we never saw another roach. Mind you he had been there maybe 2 months. In April he got the pool cleaned and looking fantastic while fixing the phone needed to call 911. He is now having painting done, and new beautiful plants installed, and it’s starting to really come together. He friendly and helpful. He has a great team of workers and a great maintenance team! I would highly recommend now."
Arbor Haus Apartments,"I HAVE HAD IT ENOUGH

I paid a refundable holding fee as clearly stated by the management. Weeks have passed, and despite multiple emails, in-person visits, and confirmations of my correct address, I have still not received my money back.
The only responses I got were vague and non-committal. It’s been extremely frustrating trying to get a straight answer or any accountability. I’ve done everything on my end—prompt communication, polite follow-ups—and yet the refund is still pending without explanation.
I would strongly caution others to think twice before trusting this management with any upfront fees, refundable or not. DO NOT FALL FOR ""REFUNDABLE HOLDING FEE"" SCAM. It literally took 2 seconds to pay for the ""refundable holding fee"" but months to get back?"
Manchester West Apartments,"I recently had the pleasure of working with Ashley, the manager at Manchester West Apartments, and I cannot speak highly enough of her professionalism and dedication. From our very first interaction, it was evident that she is committed to providing an outstanding experience for all residents.

Ashley consistently demonstrates an impressive level of professionalism. She handles every situation with grace and expertise, making it clear that she genuinely cares about the well-being of the residents.

The service Ashley provides is incredibly fast. Whether it’s responding to inquiries or addressing concerns, she is always on top of things, ensuring that everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

Her friendly demeanor makes her a joy to work with. Ashley’s warm and approachable personality creates a welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel valued as a resident.

Moreover, she goes above and beyond to be helpful. No matter the issue, Ashley is always ready to lend a hand, offer guidance, or provide solutions. Her willingness to assist truly sets her apart.

In summary, Ashley is an exceptional manager who exemplifies what great customer service should be. I am grateful for her support and highly recommend Manchester West Apartments to anyone looking for a fantastic place to live.
Thank you!"
Manchester West Apartments,"I specifically want to leave a review for Krista, she has been so so helpful as I've been looking for apartments at Manchester West and McKinley more generally. I can't sing her praises enough, she has been going above and beyond and being so friendly while doing it. She has amazing customer service skills and deserves any promotions coming her way!"
Manchester West Apartments,Matt and Ashely were the best and most kindest people I have ever met. Very funny helpful. 
Manchester West Apartments,"They outsource application review to a third party AI service, wasted 10 days talking with their chat bot providing detailed income information before deciding to cancel my application. Was approved within 24 hours at a much nicer and more expensive apartment. Don’t waste your time here"
Manchester West Apartments,"These apartments smell like smoke, and the walls are really thin so you can always hear your neighbors.

Ashlay and the old man that work with her are very rude and unprofessional.

Rent elsewhere!"
Vic Village South,"My son was accepted to the University of Michigan for Fall 2025 as a Junior transfer student.  We visited Michigan to find an apartment for him and fell in love with Vic Village.  We worked with Andrea Crites, the Community Manager at Vic South, and she was great.  Gave us a tour, and worked with us to find perfect roommates for my son. She answered all our questions and followed up with us after a couple of weeks. The apartments are clean and appear well maintained. We spoke to one student who was quite happy living there.  Coming from California, these apartments were incredibly nice! Washers and dryers in the units??? That's unheard of at any apartments near any University of California school! (For $3000+/month near UCLA you get a smelly dump, and don't even get me started on the cost and disgusting housing near UC Berkeley. Even the most expensive unit at Vic Village is significantly less money that anything at UCLA or Berkeley.).  My son was later accepted to Georgia Tech and decided to go there so he will not be living at Vic South, but I really think for anyone looking for an apartment near the University of Michigan, Vic Village is a great place.  Safe, clean, near restaurants, close to the main campus, close to the shuttle bus stop for getting to the Engineering/CS buildings, great amenities, and an outstanding manager. I can't say enough good things about these apartments."
Vic Village South,"Past resident and local here! Loved living at Vic as it's the closest apartment to central campus, near the Diag and multiple restaurants some of which stay open late for students coming back from the library or need to get food after partying. It's also very close to multiple bus stops (including the CCTC) for residents that need to commute to North Campus or anywhere across campus.

Overall, conveniently located and also has state-of-the-art amenities!"
Vic Village South,I am a parent with a child leasing and  had the most amazing experience with Andrea Crites. She walked me through everything and made it so seamless. It so nice to deal with such professional people!
Vic Village South,"I strongly do not recommend choosing this apartment. Because of the guarantor issue, I was told by email that I had to pay 1.5 times the room rate or use Leap. But I had already found another place to live, so at the beginning of May I sent an email to cancel the contract. . But the office said there was nothing they could do, even if I was willing to pay without a deposit, there was nothing they could do. The rent for this apartment is so high that it is difficult to sublet it. I later found someone who could sublet my contract, and it was stated at the beginning that it was a girl, but it was not until before signing the contract that a girl could not sublet my contract, and they would prepare a new one for her. During this period, the girl and I basically didn't reply to emails we sent. I had to call around 11 o'clock every day before someone answered. And every time I responded, I had to discuss it with my supervisor and the result was nothing. This matter has been delayed until now and has not been resolved."
Vic Village South,"Great place, right across the other one with a good gym"
Traver Crossing Apartments,"Moved out in July due to graduation.

Overall it was a pretty pleasant stay; this is a pet friendly apartment, very spacious and with a lot of storage space. The scenery and hiking paths are unbeatable in the spring.

Pros:
- on 23, for college student without a car this makes shopping and going to central/North campus much easier.
- BIG apartment. I mean BIG. Very, very big. Lots of storage space for anything you want to keep.
- pet friendly. I see a lot of furry friends around!
- beautiful community. See pics attached.

Cons/things to consider:
- 23 on workdays are very crowded. 65 exists as an alternative, but during peak hours it doesn't help much.
- rent is pretty high. My roommate and I pay $1799 in 2023 when we moved in, and even though we renewed at the earliest possible date our rent still went up, although not by much (~1% fluctuation). Compared to my old place I consider this as a pro, but YMMV.
- laundry experience is horrible. 2 washer and dryers for 2 buildings, and the price goes up by at least 50¢ per year while the dryer sometimes doesn't work well. I moved to DC to stay with a friend for a bit and their laundry was actually cheaper!
- maintenance is usually fast, but remember to communicate with them about what they did.
- if you cook a lot, their gas stove isn't very hot. A high heat is more like a medium in our unit.
- I live close to the train track, and it can be very loud at night when a train passes.

Overall, if I return, I would rent with them again provided that I'm not living in a unit alone and have my own small washer; price was one thing, the sheer amount of space was the other. My biggest and almost only complaint was the laundry. Hope this helps another hunter."
Traver Crossing Apartments,"Apartment complex overall is good, a little pricey but that’s Ann Arbor for ya.

What I actually want to talk about is how Joseph, Chris, and Leon (and everyone one else on the maintenance team this year) have been super helpful and efficient!

A big thank you to Joseph specifically, who maintains excellent lines of communication with residents, explaining the timeline for fixes, as well as explaining what the team is doing and why. My air con was broken at the start of the summer, and the team was in my unit within hours of me submitting a work order, which was amazing. I’m used to waiting days if not weeks for maintenance at previous places I’ve lived.

It’s now move in/out season which means the team is super busy, but they still take the time to say hi to me on the walkway and ask how the AC is holding up! Genuinely very impressed by the property overall, and also very happy I re-signed my lease!"
Traver Crossing Apartments,"Traver crossing is a quiet and clean community. Smoking is prohibited, and that's a huge plus. In the winter, the snow gets cleaned very fast. The community manager, Jason, has been very responsive and nice. One thing that it can improve on is the speed for maintenance, sometimes it can take weeks, but overall a great community to live in."
Traver Crossing Apartments,"Professional, responsive, punctual, and kind. We just signed up for a lease starting in July. Jason and Rosalyn were super helpful in the application process, and also helped us transfer the reservation fee from another McKinley property. Traver Crossing property itself has an awesome location, close to North Campus, but also touching a green serene space. Apartments seem clean and well maintained. Will update a review after my son moves in."
Traver Crossing Apartments,"The apartment was clean, spacious and definitely served its purpose for my family the 11mo we were there. During the winter it’s difficult to exit the complex due to the exits leading to an incline but the snow plowers eventually clear things up enough to travel.
At first I had excellent communication with the Property Manager but it seemed once we decided we wouldn’t  be renewing our lease that was hindered and the race to get us out began. It’s unfortunate  how management was able to file the papers for eviction and sending any “owed monies” to collections but couldn’t even take the time out to fill out their portion of the housing assistance Documentation to ensure my family didn’t end up homeless. (Funny thing is HAWC didn’t even get in touch with us until a week AFTER our court hearing.) I’ll continue to assume the $400 more a month the apartment listed for was much more appealing to your business practices than my family’s livelihood.
May the universe provide you with the same energy you put in to it!"
Meadowbrook Village Apartments,"I have lived at Meadowbrook Village for about 9 months, and I am quite pleased with my experience here. The administrative staff are friendly, responsive, and take pride in their work. The maintenance team is excellent; always responsive and thorough. Any issues that have arisen have always been handled quickly and taken seriously.

The neighborhood is quiet, friendly, and safe, with easy access to downtown  Ann Arbor and the highway.

Great place to live."
Meadowbrook Village Apartments,"Recently, I've had to contact Meadowbrook's administrative staff for help with several maintenance issues that I've been having in my unit and they've been responsive, amiable, and professional at every turn.

However, the real stars of the show are the maintenance staff that have been over taking care of business. I've had the pleasure of having Matt, Tyrone, and Ahmed over to help with various work orders I've lodged and they're always exceedingly helpful, considerate, and above all, good-spirited! In the places I've lived in the past, I've always dreaded having to make maintenance requests because of long waits or shoddy work -- but that has never been an issue with these three. Meadowbrook is lucky to have them!"
Meadowbrook Village Apartments,"Sara from the leasing office stayed late on a Saturday to push my application through and she was very helpful. The apartment complex is a little on the older side, but the Neighbourhood looks decent and safe. The houses are bigger than usual with the inunit washer and dryer but can’t really complain for the price point."
Meadowbrook Village Apartments,"I haven’t lived here too long, however, since I’ve lived here a few minor maintenance issues have popped up. I never got a chance to use their portal, but I mentioned these things to Matt (their maintenance person) casually and he got right on it! The guy is amazing - he lets my dog out when I need him too, keeps an eye on the place, and is an asset to the community. I can’t say too much about the apartments themselves, but Matt is awesome!"
Meadowbrook Village Apartments,"I do not recommend living in this apartment.

First of all, the unit wasn’t even cleaned when we moved in. They came to paint the walls after we had already moved in, and the chemical smell was extremely strong—it lasted for over a week and gave us headaches.

Secondly, the AC was broken when we moved in, and it made it hard to sleep. Although the apartment staff were polite, the response time was extremely slow, and it took a long time to get things fixed, which was really frustrating.

Many of the facilities break down easily, like the sliding door and the locks.

We also had a package stolen, and things only improved a bit after we installed a camera at the door.

The biggest concern came when we were away for about a week: we noticed marks on our door and that the security camera had been moved. Because it's part of an open neighborhood, there might be more safety risks.

But the absolute worst part is the winter—it’s freezing, even with the heat on. Our DTE bill was $200–300/month during the winter. The walls are paper-thin and wind comes right through them. On top of that, the windows weren’t sealed properly, so not only was it cold, but we could also clearly hear our neighbors talking.

This was by far the worst place I’ve lived in Ann Arbor."
Ridgewood Apartments,"I absolutely love my apartment and I'm happy I chose to move in here. It's a great area with nice neighbors and a pretty active community, the in unit washer and dryer is wonderful and was definitely worth signing. The people who work in the leasing office are very friendly and helpful whenever I need them. I haven't really had too many issues and I'm very satisfied with my apartment and as of now plan on staying, I recommend these apartments to whoever sees this review."
Ridgewood Apartments,"I couldn't regret moving here more. Been here less than two months and I can not wait until my lease is up next summer.

My AC has already broken/stopped working twice. First time it took a week for them to fix when it was 80+ degrees outside. Now it's not working again and I'm being told by both maintenance and the office to open a window, since it is too cool outside for it to work. I am paying a lot in rent and air conditioning. Being told to open a window when it is 80 degrees inside my apartment is completely unacceptable. Ivonne, who I was warned about, is particularly terrible, butting in on the conversation and being insistent that it wasn't their fault or responsibility. Exactly what I should've expected out of her. Do your best to avoid dealing with her and this whole complex.

I am now dreading the next thing that I will have to deal with as I'm sure it'll be far from the last."
Ridgewood Apartments,"I stayed here for a year and had to move out because of job change, but my experience has been great! First of all I really like the price for the thoughtful floorplan. Apartment has lot of natural light from big windows and balcony. Location is great within walking distance from Kroger, Aldi, Target. Secondly the management has been very responsive to any maintenance problems and all complaints were promptly resolved during my stay. And finally, I received my FULL security deposit back within a week of moving out!"
Ridgewood Apartments,"I lived at Ridgewood for 2 years. Lindsay Henson was super helpful to me from the minute I was interested in the place until the minute I left. Very helpful staff. The maintenance team was not great at first, but they quickly hired an incredible maintenance team that was fast and helpful. The amenities here are great for the price. The location is next to every store you could need, and a good spot between both Ann Arbor and ypsi. The pool in the summer was always a nice touch. It was a great pleasure to live here."
Ridgewood Apartments,"By far the best place I have rented from! I have lived in apartments that were poorly managed and had staff that were aggressively unhelpful and rude. However, the past two years at Ridgewood have been incredible. Lindsay is always willing to help and has been hospitable since the beginning. Maintenance responds to requests very quickly and will work with you until all of your concerns are resolved. I could not recommend Ridgewood more! A bonus is that the units themselves are clean and modern, and the location is great!"
Evergreen Apartments,"My house smells like roaches.

When I started encountering issues with Evergreen in November of 2023, it quickly became clear that the comfort and safety of their residents are very low priorities for McKinley. I thought I would wait until I moved out to write this review, but I haven’t even put my kitchen back together since I had to unpack half my apartment for last Wednesday's pest treatment. This place has no possibility of meeting the standards of a home, so it feels essentially the same.

While waiting yesterday for a call back about my twice-broken heat, myself and several neighbors received notices that - at any given time during business hours/days from November 12th-19th - Pittsfield Township would be entering apartments to complete code work following multiple failed inspections regarding the abysmal state of the food-blood-vomit-and feces-stained, moldy carpet in every hallway of the building; broken fire doors; and other violations.

It feels like it was just yesterday that I (unsuccessfully) requested that management place trash cans around the building because of the overflowing dumpsters and sheer quantity of omnipresent trash in the entryways, stoops, stairs, and hallways. But, in reality, that was February of 2024. It WAS yesterday that I found yet another roach carcass with her accompanying egg sac in the middle of a coffee table, far away from my kitchen.

My life has been disrupted near-daily for the past two and a half years by the unpleasant, unhygienic, unsafe conditions at Evergreen. I cannot stop thinking about the infants, children, pets, and all my other neighbors whose health suffer from living in this building.

When I needed to extensively prepare my apartment for roach treatment, my pets and I were able to stay with a friend for free for days. I don’t have to leave my pets in crates at home with strangers all day just because this company is so far behind on upkeep that the township cannot provide any specific scheduling for continued invasions of personal space and sanctuary. I bought an air purifier as a desperate band-aid for the stale, rank air in my unit. I cannot imagine what it’s like for the people in this community who do not have these options, including the option of working from home.

Working from home is the only reason that I was able to prevent a contractor from accidentally entering my unit without notice. Following the most recent failed township inspection, my moldy, warped kitchen vinyl flooring needs replacing. When a flooring contractor knocked at my door, prepared with a key in case I wasn’t home, my call to management indicated the poor communication among the people who are responsible for this community. I am reluctant to request further needed repairs in my unit, from the flooring to the chipped bathtub sealing. I just want peace in my home.

Mostly-guaranteed amenities at Evergreen Apartments include: four walls in each room (chance of infestation), frequently functional hot water and heat, occasional emergency water shutoffs, sly laundry cost increases, and - as I’m told - free smoke detector battery replacement twice a year. Pieces of wire and plastic left by the radiator for your pets or kids to eat following emergency heating repairs. Humidity, sagging ceilings, neglected and poorly-installed wall AC units, and crumbling plaster. Broken intercoms, doors, and laundry machines that leave your clothes smelling like mildew.

Maintenance is always respectful, helpful, and genuinely pleasant to interact with. However, they are almost certainly overworked and understaffed, leaving some of my neighbors with neglected repairs.

Maybe I’m a disgruntled customer. However, if you find yourself considering this property, I strongly encourage you to take a tour (if you’re able) and to talk to an Evergreen resident while you’re here. One thing I can say for sure is that McKinley’s neglect of its residents has led to a strong community within my building. My neighbors deserve better, and so do you."
Evergreen Apartments,"I have lived in Evergreen Apartments for about 3 years and while we have had some issues (to be expected in an older building) the leasing and maintenance teams have been great in addressing concerns and are always very kind. Given the age of the building and appliances there have definitely been issues like pests, mold, and appliances not always working fully but it is generally quiet and well maintained.

A special shout out to Lori on the maintenance team! Any time she comes by to fix something she is super nice and takes time to explain why and how repairs will go. She also goes out of her way to say hello to my pups whether she is helping us out or just passing by while we are out on walks ☺️"
Evergreen Apartments,"The management team at Evergreen Apartments arranged for the replacement of two bathroom sinks and toilets.  The job was assigned to Dionte Logwood who managed the replacement  and cleanup very efficiently.  In addition to his focus on the job, we had a wonderful conversation, which is so important in relationship building and a job well done. The positive end result is, of course, new sinks and toilets. But as important as that is to me; Dionte  represented how important it is to Evergreen Apartments."
Evergreen Apartments,"A lot of these 5 star reviews are nothing but fake!! Here is my genuine review for living here. I would not recommend Evergreen Apartments. They fail to address repair issues promptly, and the apartments often have cockroaches. The washers and dryers frequently remain out of service for long periods, causing significant inconvenience. The charges for water and sewer are exorbitantly high, even if you use very little. The management is unhelpful and rather than resolving problems, they terminate leases. The complex also has a history of terrible neighbors, frequent crimes, and police presence almost daily, making it feel very unsafe. Not forgetting the toxic mold! Overall, this has been a very disappointing experience, and I cannot recommend living here."
Evergreen Apartments,"I lived in Evergreen for three years. It was the worst experience ever the mann people with horrible water was one in my bathroom for months. It had black mole in my bathroom because the water ran so long. The office staff was rude. I got my brand-new Mercedes truck scratch in their parking lot and nobody Took responsibility for it. They never changed the carpet in three years. They never fixed anything in three years, it was the worst experience I ever had with apartment if anybody put Put five star that is fake in the hallway always stink and dirty and disgusting."
Manchester Flats Apartments,"This is the absolute worst place I have ever lived due to management. They don’t seem to care about their residents in the slightest.

I’ve been dealing with a safety concern due to other residents for months and they are unresponsive. I’ve had to call 911 on other residents because they are fighting and threatening to shoot & stab people. Management said they can’t tell me anything about how they’re handling it because of privacy concerns… I’m sorry but I don’t really care about their privacy when I had a man 6 ft outside my window threatening to shoot everyone. I don’t think Brittany would want to live in those conditions either.

It takes weeks to get a response, if you ever get one. One time there was a lady who was screaming outside for an extended period of time and then she pulled her pants down and pissed on the sidewalk in broad daylight and I never heard anything back from management when I reported it. If you lived in building 1832 in September 2025, you probably unknowingly stepped in a big puddle of piss and tracked it into your apartment.

When I first moved in, the keys they gave me didn’t work on my apartment door. After talking to the community manager at the time, I found out they never changed the locks before I moved in and they told me to wait until Monday because it wasn’t an emergency (I moved in on a Friday). I had to call and beg them to send someone to change my lock so I could lock my new apartment full of all of my belongings. They begrudgingly agreed to send someone on Saturday morning, so I couldn’t lock my door on the first night.

A few weeks before I moved in, they told me the 1-bedroom apartment I had reserved was no longer available and my only option was to take a 2-bedroom. I still had to pay rent for the 2-bedroom with only a few weeks notice even though it was their mistake that they had promised me an apartment that didn’t exist.

These are only a few examples of the many issues I’ve had here. It feels like I’m never at peace here because I’m always dealing with some ridiculous issue that management refuses to address.

They never answer the phones. They are never in the office. Maintenance is rude and unhelpful. I wouldn’t live in this complex again if they paid ME."
Manchester Flats Apartments,"Old, old building and too expensive for what it offers. Electrical issues, power kept going out and fuses going out but has OLD fuse bulbs instead of switches. unsafe power outlets. Plumbing issues, bathroom sinks don’t drain easily. Upstairs apartment had a water leak onto my ceiling, maintenance cut a hole in the ceiling to fix and left it like that until my lease ended — which allowed a moldy, musty smell and bugs in the apartment. No central air or dishwasher. Was ~$4 to complete one load of laundry in the basement IF it wasn’t broken or leaking, or if the sinks weren’t clogged and overflowing onto the floor. Painting everywhere including over mold, water damage, doors and hinges instead of replacing. Painted bath tubs to cover old tubs instead of replacing or cleaning, which chips away as the lease goes on.
Parking is free but SO crammed people would constantly scrape or door ding my car. Someone even crashed into my car when I lived there.

Either adjust the prices to reflect the quality of the apartments or remodel and fix the whole complex IMO"
Manchester Flats Apartments,"TL;DR: Manchester Flats offers cute, affordable, and well-located apartments, but McKinley’s management enforces questionable policies—especially a problematic bed bug lease addendum—and exhibits harassing behavior that may violate state law. Proceed with caution and read the lease carefully.

Manchester Flats apartments have a lot going for them: they’re on the bus line, close to downtown, and relatively affordable for Ann Arbor—especially for those on PhD stipends or a tight budget. The hardwood floors and abundant sunlight are definite pluses. The buildings are old and have minor maintenance issues, but nothing major.

The real downside is McKinley’s management.

In 2025, they introduced a Bed Bug Lease Addendum with two alarming clauses:
1. They could evict tenants within seven days if bed bugs were found.
2. If they determined the tenant was responsible, they could hold the tenant financially liable for all treatment costs, including those for adjoining units.

I had bed bugs during my tenancy (not the only unit affected) and did everything possible to address the issue, including buying a new mattress and deep cleaning. I support policies that require tenants and landlords to promptly and thoroughly address bed bug issues.

However, the landlord’s powers in this addendum—even if aimed at non-cooperative tenants—are alarming. My lawyer advised that these terms may violate Michigan state law. When I raised these concerns, management dismissed them, saying the addendum would apply to all their properties and would not be changed for one tenant.

I had fully intended to resign another year, but given the recent nature of my bed bug experience, I couldn't rationally agree to all these new addendum terms.

After I gave notice not to renew, management’s behavior devolved further:
* They responded to my non-renewal notice with a single “tada”/""party popper"" 🎉 emoji (an attempt to celebrate my departure amongst themselves discreetly? They quietly tried to remove it later, but - unfortunately for them - such reactions leave an electronic paper trail)
* They immediately misrepresented lease terms and threatened me with improper holdover charges. (I didn’t hold over the apartment - I left early, nearly two weeks early before the lease ended)
* They refused to accept my written non-renewal notice unless I used their official forms (not required by the lease).
* When I turned in my keys a week early, they tried to enforce an undocumented policy against accepting them early (but eventually did).

These behaviors greatly overshadowed what had been an overall 5/5 experience. But I cannot recommend living here with this specific management in control.

If you’re considering signing a lease here, don’t. But if you must, READ IT CAREFULLY—especially the bed bug addendum. And be prepared to deal with management behaviors like the ones I described - or worse."
Manchester Flats Apartments,"Nervous to post publicly for fear of retaliation.
Recently we went 2.5 weeks without a working shower . It’s a basic right of a tenant to have working plumbing. I am patient and understanding but ..
The photos are current- of the ceiling and walls that were opened for maintenance on pipes . In January.
Wondering why the Ann Arbor Inspectors were concerned but no change …

Manchester Flats Apartments,"I've lived in this apartment complex for many years. When I asked to switch from a two-bedroom to a one-bedroom, I was told that even though my current lease ends in mid-July and has already been fully paid, I couldn't move into the one-bedroom at the end of June. They only allow new leases to start three days early, which seems extremely inflexible and unreasonable—especially for long-term tenants who wish to stay in the same community."
Vic Village North,"My family was recently exploring housing possibilities for a University of Michigan student and Caitlin, Alex, and other staff at Vic Village North (and South) were super helpful, courteous and friendly! We heard nice reviews from other students about the living experience at Vic Village North, too!"
Vic Village North,I have lived in five different places since I started college and Vic Village is far and away the best one. The management staff is extremely kind and they are willing to help with any situation at a moments notice. The common spaces are kept extremely clean and the maintenance staff is great! The amenities are my favorite part of Vic and are what separates it from a lot of other places. Living in Vic has been a tremendous experience and I have met countless friends as a result of it!
Vic Village North,"Staff has been extremely professional, and easy to deal with. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the market for an apartment. The apartments are clean and the building is well looked after by the management team. This is also a great location for anyone looking to rent and attend school at the University of Michigan, super close to the campus!
10/10 would recommenced this building."
Vic Village North,"Don't live here. The rent is a little high but that's honestly not the worst thing at Vic. The staff is the worst especially the office manager. Simple paperwork take forever to be completed and is sometimes filled out incorrectly, which just leads to more paperwork and more waiting. My apartment had a conflict and the manager was not only unhelpful, but was very unprofessional about the entire situation. When I first moved in my apartment was disgusting with old food caked on to the kitchen floor and on every appliance. The manager claimed that someone had cleaned the apartment and refused to listen to what I had to say about the cleanliness of the apartment. They did call the cleaner after I had already began cleaning things myself. This is just a fraction of what happened in a semester of living at vic village. Don't live here, there are better places that are more deserving of your money and will treat you with respect."
Vic Village North,Vic Village is a great apartment building and is centrally located on campus making it a quick walk to everything. The staff is great and friendly which made me want to work here. All of the amenities and apartments are brand new compared to the other apartment buildings in the area. I definitely recommend living here.
Arbor Club Apartments,"Tamara the property manager was very professional and understanding prior to me moving to Arbor Club I had a scheduled tour. Somehow it didn't come through. But she was very nice, and courteous. Upon showing me my apartment, Which is very nice btw.. Access to the swimming pool, gym, and there's a trail to walk on. It's very peaceful and quiet. she explained in detail very well the application process and answered any questions I had. She's really Sweet and carries herself in a professional manner. Grateful to have her as a property manager."
Arbor Club Apartments,Love the office staff! They are always so kind and help with whatever I need. Kudos to Jennifer and Tamara!!! I definitely recommend living here.
Arbor Club Apartments,"I'm giving this poor review rate b/c of a very bad experience and service I've received. I recommend don't deal with this property management and look for a different rentals.
I was approaching this property because it offers a short term lease starting from 3 months lease, which was what I needed as my close relative was planned to visit us in town for 3 months. I told the office manager that this is for my relative coming for a three months visit, in several visits I made to this property. I've submitted the application online and paid the application fee and the holding fee. The day before the rent start date, I came over again, with the rent payment check and expected to receive the keys. To my amazement, I was shocked to find out that the lease term was changed to 12 months and more fees were requested, totaled in $700 fees in order to get the keys.
I was shocked and refused to make this deal. I was very upset and had to cancel many services I planed for this rental, such as rental insurance, movers, Xfinity and DTE. I had to look for a new place quickly, since my relative was about to arrive the day after. Because of this rude service, I demanded from the office manager to be refunded for the holding fee and the application fee I paid. The office manager said I will be refunded in 48 hours. I have never received the refund and every time I called they said they are working on it. After 3 months they said that the billing department confirmed I will not be refunded.
I've never seen such a rude business. Stay away!"
Arbor Club Apartments,"I’ll start with saying I have LOVED living here.  I came across Arbor Club during a visit to Ann Arbor to find a place before relocating from Texas for work.

The property itself is well maintained (updates being made very year it seems).  I was able to move into a newly renovated unit that had both Gas stove and in unit washer and dryer!

The maintenance team and management have been nothing but exemplary!  Maintenance are prompt and timely with any service requests I have had.  Same can be said about the office team as well!  Both interact with a positive, friendly manner and made me feel right at home.

Interactions have been great with neighbors as well, was nice some even made a little home garden by the maintenance shed.  I look forwards to attempting to green thumb some here this spring and summer!

I highly recommend living here if you have the opportunity"
Arbor Club Apartments,"Arbor Club is a great place to live. It is conveniently located near shopping and restaurants. I liked that it is tucked away around beautiful neighborhoods as well. The apartment was spacious and very clean. Maintenance was great and timely. The manager, Leah, and her staff are awesome! They make Arbor Club feel like a family. It was a perfect spot for me as a U of M student. Leah is completely accessible and cares greatly about all of the residents. She was helpful and supportive when I had some roommate issues. She handled everything with professionalism and kindness."
400 Maynard Apartments,"The location and property management are okay, but everything else is awful. We received emails almost every week about elevator problems. If you can deal with all those issues, go for it…..but honestly, it’s not worth it except for the location.

1. During the summer, the A/C doesn’t cool the room enough.
2. One of treadmill in the gym doesn’t work.
3. Laundry and dryer are not in-unit; you have to pay and go down to the basement.
4. You can hear almost everything from your neighbors.
5. The water gets clogged easily, and the stove has constant problems.

Good luck!"
400 Maynard Apartments,I recently did a walk-through for fall 2026 for my daughter!  I think this is gonna be the next place that she calls home for the next four years!  The staff was nice and they have a cute little tea shop attached to the building that was delicious! The rooftop was spectacular.  You could see the big house and actually hear the band practicing! Go blue!
400 Maynard Apartments,"I’ve really enjoyed living here! The property manager is so kind, helpful, and always quick to respond. They truly care about the residents and make this place feel like home. Highly recommend!"
400 Maynard Apartments,"Great location. Older building, therefore a lot of maintenance issues. Elevators are unreliable, and at times fully broken for days at a time due to “modernization”. It was an alright 2 years, but given the amount of newer housing in the area for the same price, you are better off living somewhere with more reliable elevators and AC."
400 Maynard Apartments,Nice place!!  I like the location and the apartments are clean.  The building is a little older but super well maintained and managed!! The new manager is a 10/10!
The Standard at Ann Arbor,"As a parent of a resident, I'd caution anyone looking at this property due to the high concentration of homeless. The proximity to the Beer Depot and gas station across the street are contributing factors. In addition, there's concentration across Packard given a community services facility. I've personally been accosted in the alleyway behind the building, moving our kid in. The homeless congregate, deal and consume drugs in alcoves of the building, and management has chosen to take no responsibility. A simple security guard would make a considerable difference. Buyer beware."
The Standard at Ann Arbor,"The community manager, Cassie, has taken real ownership of her role. Anything I have needed to call the property, either here or one of the team member have always been warm and attentive. It not often seen to have such a level care in this day and age, but The Standard at Ann Arbor brings it every time. I appreciate you guys ✨"
The Standard at Ann Arbor,"Recent updates and changes have made this facility a new favorite.
Leasing team was very helpful and quick to work with.
When asked about the amenities, updates and changes have been made and are all functional and clean.
The maintenance team was pleasant to work with.
Overall I'm highly satisfied with living here!"
The Standard at Ann Arbor,"I lived at The Standard for 3 years. The only reason I stayed is because of the convenience of the gym (that is literally the only reason because to me the gym matters a ton). Other than that, if you don't have money to waste, DO NOT MOVE HERE. The following are just a few of my negative experiences:
1. Move in day, my move in time was 1PM, but the process was so inefficient and poorly thought-out, that I wasn't able to move in until 6PM. The instructions they gave us involved me waiting in  line in my car for 5 hours. For a company that has had tons of experience with opening buildings and moving residents, in, they sure created the worst move-in process I've ever seen or experienced.
2. The door to the balcony's hinges were too weak for how heavy the door is, and the wind blew the door open, causing the hinges to break, and the door to be permanently stuck in an open position. At the same time, the AC broke. This was the middle of summer. I had bugs and dust flying in, the humidity and heat, and NO AC. And they didn't fix the door for 2-3 months, and the AC for around 4 months. By the time they got the AC fixed, it was already getting cold inside. And because of the door, there was a layer of dust on everything in the kitchen and living room, which I had to clean myself. They kept using the excuse that ""parts are taking long to ship,"" but I don't think that's a proper reason. What parts take A MONTH to ship? As far as I'm concerned, the city of Ann Arbor requires large maintenance issues (like AC or doors to the outside) to be fixed within 1-2 weeks, but the Standard staff knows that us students don't have the time or money to sue or get legal involvement. I asked if I could get a refund of some sort or if they could install a wall or window unit. They refused. They offered for me to stay in a different apartment temporarily, but I had somewhere to stay already, so that was useless.
3. For the first year I lived in a studio apartment in front of the trash room, which normally would be fine. Except for a few weeks here and there, they'd let the trash pile up outside of the trash room and right up to my door. I had to move bags out of the way to access my room. When I complained to the front desk, they blamed it on the city and asked if I had a solution... like isn't your job to find a solution on where to put the trash? It's definitely a safety hazard to have trash leaking out into my apartment.
4. For the first year, they overcharged my heating in the winter. And multiple other people on my floor also experienced the same. I even kept my room at 60 at some points just to reduce the heating cost, and they still charged me 400-500 a month, just for the heating bill. They never returned the money.
5. There were cars constantly parking in the spot that I pay monthly for, and when I contacted the tow company, the number went to nowhere. I continuously asked the front desk if they could install more signs to tell people not to park in my spot, but they refused.
6. They entered my bedroom without giving me 24 hour notice and worked with the dry-wall, which left dust everywhere on my bed and floor, which I had to clean.
7. When I moved from my studio to a 4-bedroom unit, they kept pushing back my move-in date ON THE DAY OF. No notice, just me going down to the front desk and asking if today was still my move-in day, and them continuously saying ""no you can move in tomorrow."" Then when I moved in, nothing was cleaned. There was just one guy staying late at 11PM, cleaning only my room. And the cleaning guy specifically said that the front desk staff instructed him to ONLY clean my room. He offered to clean the kitchen and living room, but I said it was fine because it was so late and I felt bad for him (none of this was his fault), and I cleaned everything myself.
8. My car got broken into twice in the parking garage. I reported it twice with no response or call back. And the garage doors are constantly broken, which is dangerous since that area has a high concentration of homeless people."
The Standard at Ann Arbor,"The amenities at The Standard are incredible!! They have a pool, a HUGE outside television (similar size to a Jumbotron) and lots of space for studying available to residents. The new staff there are also super helpful and friendly. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an apartment in Ann Arbor!"
