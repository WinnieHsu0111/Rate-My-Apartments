I'm very excited to be moving to Ann Arbor :) I'm 31 and it's just me.

I'm currently renting a (very) small house built in the 30s in a quiet wooded area in Southeastern US: it's been fun, but the bathroom, kitchen and appliances leave much to be desired.

As a result, I wouldn't mind paying more to live with some nice amenities, especially with my pay raise! 

Looking for 1/2bedroom. My dream is a complex that offers a sauna (I'm part Finnish). I'd love suggestions?

(I'm not a big redditor so if this is the wrong place to post, let me know and I'm sorry-- please don't yell at me!) I’ve really enjoyed living here! The property manager is so kind, helpful, and always quick to respond. They truly care about the residents and make this place feel like home. Highly recommend!

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Captain Sovlin, United Nations Fleet Command***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 3, 2136*

The shadow fleet disengaged from any direct confrontation with the Arxur. After protecting the warpers, aggression was not suitable to our survival. Padding the distance between us and the enemy was our first priority. Lighter Terran ships acted as a buffer, and drew the grays’ attention with hit-and-run tactics. A gradual retreat occurred without substantive strikes from the arboreal predators.

From the fleetwide chatter, it sounded like the UN planned to sink their heels in for days. I didn’t understand how prolonging this conflict’s duration helped our cause. How long could any sapient maintain combat readiness for? Perhaps the humans were willing to drop dead of exhaustion if the grays bit the bullet too.

*There’s also the question of our warp fleet, and if they’re coming back. Humans don’t desert out of cowardice, do they?*

I trusted that the Terrans had a plan at work, and that military flightiness was uncommon on Earth. There had never been a chance of holding Sillis, which was presently encircled by Arxur ships. This was about proving that humanity wouldn’t go down with a whimper; the grays would have to claw for every nanoparsec.

Tyler clapped his Yotul pal on the shoulder. “Get us a quick visual on this asteroid. Shift back in the grays’ direction afterward.”

A space rock was making a pass close to Sillis (in astronomical terms) concurrent with the battle. The United Nations selected it as our cover to hunker down. This oblong body was conducive to defensive positioning, and it prevented the Arxur from targeting us at a distance. The grays were still following us into the great beyond, unwilling to let us escape. We needed a chance to outfox them.

To ensure our fortress held, we also deployed short-range FTL disruptors. The last thing humanity needed was for the enemy to warp in on our haunches, and mow us down without warning. Curiously, the Arxur hadn’t enacted a similar barrier to stop our vessels from trying the same thing. Dominion ships might not possess anti-FTL capabilities, since no foe had the gumption to drop atop them before.

Arxur craft had fanned out around the asteroid, attempting to swallow it whole. I got a brief glimpse of the crater-pocked surface, as Onso focused the viewport. Captain Monahan positioned us with a sightline around the asteroid, while keeping the ship frame nestled in its shadow. The Terran fleet unleashed a slew of kinetics alongside us. There was no rest for the weary during this f

First, I would believe that the threats and harassment end up under disorderly persons calls and arrests\*. Then, I wanted to see how the number of calls and arrests related to disorderly persons changed over the past few years. Unfortunately, the data only goes back until 2019, so that will have to do for now.

\*Arrest in this context means either being taken to jail OR having a court summons issued and being released on the spot without ever being taken to a police station or jail.

**The Number of Disorderly Persons Calls Doubled, But the Number of Arrests Made for Disorderly Persons Charges Decreased by a Third**

[https:\/\/imgur.com\/2MfBE9i](https://preview.redd.it/wsc0r6w4d57f1.png?width=4000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66d7a3b0e21c0608015e22e0803c954f506e877)

From 2019 to 2024, the number of calls about disorderly persons rose from just under 1,500 calls to just over 3,000 calls: a 2x increase. In the same period, the number of arrests made for disorderly persons fell from just over 170 to just under 110: a decrease of almost a third.

[https:\/\/imgur.com\/n0GbgsM](https://preview.redd.it/x86pd8kma57f1.png?width=4800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=29ba4ad8ca8f975537e7e712b1b67bdf3c7a4704)

This means that in 2019, there was 1 arrest made for just about every 8 calls about a disorderly person. In 2024, that number rose to over 25 calls for a single arrest.

**The Increase in the Number of Disorderly Persons Calls Exceeded the Increase in Total Calls**

[https:\/\/imgur.com\/nL7VQ3H](https://preview.redd.it/75yq8z1dd57f1.png?width=4800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddbd620130ad9d29e70837a0e52527b348c14d3d)

The proportion of total calls related to disorderly persons has steadily risen throughout the past five years. In 2019, only a little less than 1 out of every 40 calls was related to a disorderly person. By 2024, that number increased to almost 1 out of every 20 calls.

**What Agenda are You Trying to Push? What Do You Want Done?**

I don't know; I don't really have an opinion one way or the other. In my anecdotal experience (although I think that anecdotes are largely worthless to draw conclusions from), I have also experienced increased harassment and threats from people over the past few years.

One thing that I think is important to note (that I saw in the other thread) is the discussion around housing affordability in response to this.

Obviously, the lack of affordable housing is a huge problem. I don't think that it is what is causing the harassment that lots of people have encountered. If you've witnessed the reasons behind these calls, the people that harass others are obviously mentally unwell. Whether it's drugs, disease, or what else, what's keeping them from being peaceful members of a community is more than just the lack of a roof over their heads. I am nowhere close to being informed enough to recommend some solution, but I thought that was an important distinction to make.

\*Quick disclaimer: I've tried to post this on r/AnnArbor multiple times and even messaged the mods, but they for some reason don't seem particularly keen on having this be posted with all my posts being autoremoved. This is highly relevant to U-M as well, so I figured people might find it interesting here as well. I’ve really enjoyed living here!

Looking to move to Ann Arbor, are there any areas I should avoid while apartment searching?  I am looking to relocate but do not know much in terms of areas. Apartment listings always put their best foot forward so just getting an idea if there’s any that should be avoided. I recently did a walk-through for fall 2026 for my daughter!

They truly care about the residents and make this place feel like home. Highly recommend! Given the cost of houses in Ann Arbor Maybe $10-$15,000 for a whole house generator isn't such a big deal?  It would add only, what, about 3% to the price of an average house, right?

We're getting by (and keeping our food cold) with an inverter connected to our car idling in the driveway and some long extension cords.  But if outages are going to be this long and this frequent, maybe it's time to bite the bullet and buy a generator.

I'm not sure what you're supposed to do if you live in an apartment though.

The thing that puzzles me is...what changed?  We've lived here a long time, and power outages used to be very infrequent.  The power lines weren't buried 20 years ago either, but we weren't seeing these problems.  Did DTE slack off on trimming?  Or on maintaining and upgrading equipment?  At this point, 'bad luck' seems an increasingly unlikely explanation, and the storms we've had this year don't seem unusual compared to recent history.","**Location**

See Inequality Media, Robert Reich, Heather Cox Richardson, Stacie Abrams, #SistersInLaw, Strict Scrutiny. I have lived at several properties over the years, and 618 S Main is undoubtedly the best. The property is impeccably maintained and cared for. The office staff, especially Alex and Shavon, are exceptional and responsive. They regularly organize resident events and maintain a festive atmosphere during the holidays. The gym and pool facilities are excellent. The location is ideal, with easy walking access to all downtown Ann Arbor restaurants. I've enjoyed living here for 3 years already and plan to stay even longer. The trees and forests aren't getting any smaller. Ann Arbor needs to bury it's powerlines. If DTE wont do it, then we need public power. I had a realization earlier today. If you look up historical paintings, drawings and photos of Ann Arbor a few years after it was founded, you'll see that there were almost no trees in sight. Because of logging that occurred across the entire nation at the time, forests were almost entirely cleared out, including Ann Arbor. When Ann Arbor electrified almost 100 years ago, there weren't many trees, and the trees there were probably weren't particularly large. Now, Ann Arbor is sometimes called tree town. After all these years trees naturally started growing in, and many were introduced into neighborhoods. On top of that, in su

The only competent person remaining is the maintenance guy—he's great and always helpful. But everything else has declined.

The community events used to be something I looked forward to. Krista once organized a full catered soup bar that was genuinely delicious. Now? The new team put out two crock pots of undercooked frozen soup. It was gross. When someone politely brought this up, they were basically laughed out of the room—as if it was wrong to expect quality.

There was also a “Coke Day,” which was literally just handing out cans of soda from a fridge. No thought or effort (at least grab the glass bottles if you’re going to do something like that).

The biggest disappointment is that they raised my rent by over $200 this year, yet I’m getting less than I did before. No improvements, no upgrades, and a steep decline in what used to make this place feel like a community.

Nothing works anymore, and the events that made living here enjoyable are gone. This is my last lease—definitely not worth it anymore. Ann Arbor School Board releases Plante Moran audit findings  “The original budget presented was improbable and was maybe based on hope,” Plante Moran Partner Michele McHale said. “Without significant expenditure reductions, the obvious red flags should have been identified by management and the board, for which responsibility for the current situation is shared.

AVIA Lofts on Victors Way,"Worst experience I've ever had. They processed my application with a $53 application fee and declined it for no reason. Kristi told me that I should have no trouble getting my application accepted once I showed her my deposit and credit score. But it turns out differently. They rejected my application and I could not get in touch with them for a long period. I had to drive to their office every time, they usually weren't there, and they didn't return my calls. They misrepresented the application process, the acceptance rate, and the availability of the property, claiming to hold it for me but ultimately booking it for someone else. Kristi called me a few months later to let me know that the apartment they claimed they would hold for me was already taken up by someone else and that they had another one available, but it was significantly more expensive. She added that she would follow up with me for further details. However, since then, I haven't gotten a call.  Also, they did not refund my application fee either. Need Advice - Ann Arbor Rentals  Hi guys!  

I'll be joining U-M as a graduate student this fall and am looking to rent an apartment in Ann Arbor. I'm looking at single as well as double bed apartments at the moment (might be sharing the apartment with a fellow student).  

I've parsed through some 50+ apartment listings (U-M ""beyond the diag"", trulia, zillow, [apartments.com](http://apartments.com), google etc.) and looked at as many public forums as I could find, to try to consolidate a reasonably accurate picture of each of them, but of course, there's only so much I can find out just by browsing - that too, sitting in another continent. I don't fly into USA until mid August, so there's no way for me to view these apartments in person before I move in (and I don't think I should wait till mid-August to apply for housing). 

So I wanted to ask you guys about these few listings, which one is the *least frustrating* apartment complex to live in? If you could give me some input on this, it would be super helpful 😭🩷✨

I still don’t have a status update on my application and I need to move immediately. It was strange that I had to link my bank account to the application and contact third party “guarantors” — I’ve never heard of such a thing. The guy showing me the apartment was friendly and responsive, but overall the process seemed weird, especially since very few people appear to be renting here. Still definitely want the apartment, but really need some clarity and straight answers. Thanks. I'm a police officer in a small town in Texas and I have some strange stories to tell (Part 3) For those that are just tuning in: Mineral Wells is a small town in Texas where I’ve been working for 5 years as a police officer.  It’s located somewhere north of interesting and south of scary as shit, where the citizens are strange, the events are stranger, and the past is never past.

After James confided in me about his experience with his great-grandmother’s ghost, we didn’t really talk about things like again for a while. Even though he believed he may have experienced something and had most likely seen other odds things in his time as a police officer, he still didn’t *really*  believe in the paranormal, although he wanted to. Almost like there was a veil in front of his eyes which prevented him from seeing what was really happening in Mineral Wells. I on the other hand, had abandoned all hope of “talking myself out of” believing in this stuff. I was fully invested.

I had my next run-in about a year later.  James was out sick, the flu I believe, and I responded to a vagrancy call at the old Norwood Hospital.  It had been abandoned for some time and we had gotten constant reports that a man was living on the third floor and making a racket at all hours of the night. Initially, the MWPD had sort of looked the other way, the reason for which I was not privy to, but this time I was told to go over there immediately and get him out of there if possible. I arrived just after 10:00 p.m. and parked my squad car across the street.  The Norwood hospital had been built sometime around 1904, I believe, when Dr. Norwood and his wife had moved to Mineral Wells.  It was used as a private hospital, as far as I know, and Dr. Norwood apparently even had some tie to T.B Baker, but I couldn’t recall what it was. 

As I was walking up to the entrance, I noticed the flicker of a light in the third story window, most likely a candle, confirming that someone was up there.  The front door was still boarded up, but there was a window on the left side of the front of the building that had been broken and all of the glass removed.  I pulled out my flashlight and climbed in.  

The inside of the building had decayed with age and all of the signs you’d expect in a vagrancy were present.  There were old clothes on the floor, empty food containers, beer cans, and the place was in extremely poor condition.  The smell was awful, too.  I checked the first floor and found nothing.  There was an open door that appeared to lead to a basement, but I decided that would not be on my agenda for the night. 

The second floor was much like the first, except there was also a room that looked like it may have been a nursery or a child’s play room, littered with old stuffed toys, a rocking horse, and several rotting bunk beds. Just as you’d expect, it creeped me out royally.

As I drove back down the long driveway under those old oaken sentinels, picturing Mary alone with her tea and her dogs, I felt a feeling of sadnesss and weight envelop me, like being wrapped in a thick blanket on the bottom of the ocean.  I drove on.

That night, I parked my squad car across the street from the Norwood as I had several days earlier. I was on the clock and could easily explain my purpose for being here if questioned about it. And sure enough, as I stepped out of my vehicle I could see the light again, flickering in the third floor window like a modern day will-o-the-wisp.  I opened the trunk and grabbed the black satchel inside. 

Once inside the building, I navigated through the grime and decay to the black hole in the wall that led down to the basement.  Thank God for flashlights, I thought.  The darkness there seemed palpable, like it was a living entity all its own. I started down the steps, ten in all, and counted each as I went.  If I were to lose my light source for any reason, or if I was running, I’d at least have a decent chance of getting back up the stairs without falling and hurting myself.  I had also noted that it was 22 steps roughly from the door to the basement stairs.  You can never be too careful. 

Once I made it down, I felt the grit of soil beneath my boots.  I guess it made sense that the basement wasn’t fully complete in a building as old as this.  Surprisingly, it was relatively clean down there, but that was the only positive.  The air was damp and musty and heavy with the weight of the building’s history.  As I swung my flashlight, the darkness retreated on cue, but grudgingly. Old equipment littered the floor along with some decayed furniture and other furnishings.  I didn’t see any filing cabinets, though.  No papers, folders, nothing.  I cursed myself silently for thinking this was a good idea, but pressed on.  The second room felt darker than the first somehow.  A cabinet had overturned and there were broken vials and bottles littering the ground.  I stepped around them and was surprised when there wasn’t another door in front of me, just an old coal stove, flanked on either side by piles of old bricks and some old rafters.  The stairs to the basement were in the back of the building and I knew I hadn’t made it back to the front.  I doubled back and made sure there were no other rooms or passageways before heading back to the room with the stove.  I shined my light around.  

I noticed the back wall was brick and that there was a crack running up from behind the stove halfway to the ceiling. Immediately I began removing bricks from the pile in front of the wall until I had enough room to slowly nudge the iron stove out of the way. 
It was just as I had thought. At some point this basement had flooded, eroding the earth beneath the brick wall and causing the bricks to crack, since the wall had no weight to hold it.  I had done construction in the past and had seen this before. This wall had been built shoddily and probably in a hurry.  At the bottom, the bricks weren’t being held together by mortar at all, and a few light kicks created just what I needed to proceed. 

A passageway, under the old brick wall, into Hell, for all I knew. 

My heart was pounding and I absolutely did not want to go in.  I have no trouble admitting that now.  I had come too far to turn back, though.  So, I got on my hands and knees and crawled through the small opening.

As I stood up and dusted myself off, my heart froze in my chest.  Filing cabinets, rows of them.  They were similar to the kind offices use today, except they were made of solid wood, probably oak, and very well preserved for their age.  They had brass plates on the outside with descriptions. the room appeared to be untouched after all these years.  Mary had been right! I walked along the wall quickly, not wanting to waste any more time in this place than I had to, until I found the cabinet I was looking for, the one marked *Experimental*.
*Experimental*. The word itself seemed evil, somehow.

I slowly opened it, and over the creak of wood sliding on wood, I thought I heard the faint laughter of children.  A cold sweat broke out over the skin of my arms and I got the feeling that I was being watched.  I grabbed as many files as I could fit in my satchel, closed the drawer, and turned to leave. That’s when I saw *them*.
 
In the middle of the room, standing perfectly still, was a group of children.  I was paralyzed, not by any external force, but by the grip of unadulterated fear.  They looked back at me, eyes blinking almost in unison, with gleeful smiles.  Then, it was as if a record skipped and the children standing there…..changed.  I recoiled in horror as I realized what I was seeing. The girl standing in front had two blank, scarred holes for her eyes. The younger boy next to her waved, his hand bearing only 2 fingers and a thumb.  Another boy was on the floor, pulling himself forward with the stumps of two missing legs dragging behind. There were others in the same condition. The record skipped again and they were whole, all standing still again, grinning from ear to ear. 

I found my body could move again, so I turned and ran as fast as any human ever had before, crawling under the wall before sprinting the rest of the way out of that godforsaken building, back through the basement, ten steps up, twenty-two steps out. As I ran, I heard the children singing behind me.  As it got louder, I realized it wasn’t a song, but a nursery rhyme, one that still haunts me to this very day:

*One for tongue and two for nose,*

*Three for eyes and four for toes,*

*Ring the bell, the time is near,*

*Ding, dong, Marianna’s here.*

*Ding, dong, Marianna’s here.*

The 2022 Real Estate Collapse is going to be Worse than the 2008 One, and Nobody Knows About It - Time to Call your Mom There's going to be a lot of text here, so all you smooth brain apes who are on reddit, a text based website, yet are still to retarded to read, can skip to the end where there will be a very short summary, a bottle of milk from your mother, and a blankie.

First, lets talk about the part of the real estate market that's gonna go bust that everyone knows about (or at least that people who pay attention to this shit or read my previous DDs know about): CMBS.  This is the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Market.  These are loans on commercial buildings that have been securitized, bundled, and sold to investors.  The following is an explanation of the CMBS issues I wrote for another DD over six months ago:

*The CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) Bomb*

*This one is a bit different from the mess we had in 2008 with MBS (mortgage backed securities) because it's a different market with different rules, and it's a smaller total market than MBS.*

*That said, the problems here might actually be worse. There is a company called Ladder Capital, formed out of the remnants of the Bear Stearns bond department, that has struck an unusual deal with Dollar Store, and they have a LOT of properties that are very, very much coasting on made up mortgages. I could easily write like three pages on this one partnership alone, but I'll just summarize instead and say these people learned absolutely nothing from 2008 except that it was a profitable scam that carried no jail time.*

*To understand just how bad the CMBS mess is, you need to understand how CMBS' work. At first glance, they're similar to regular MBS, it's a bundle of tens or hundreds of mortgages for commercial properties, they're divided into tranches (usually six) and the lowest tranches pay out the highest yields but also fail first. And now things get a little complex, so I'm going to simplify like crazy here, but this is the most important part to understand why this is all going to blow up.*

*A commercial building is an income generating property, it's market value is derived from how much income it generates. The bank lending you the money will want you to put up some amount of collateral for the loan. If rents go up, the amount of collateral you have to post goes down. If rent goes down, the amount of collateral you have to post goes UP. Now the weird thing about CMBS loans is that if only half your building is rented, you can just pay half your mortgage and whatever you owe for the other half of the building just gets added to the end of the loan. Now, say you can't rent out the empty half of your building, and you want to renegotiate the terms of your loan rather than just keep adding debt to the back of your loan. Well, this is where the CMBS comes into play, because all those different tranches? The investors behind them have different incentives, the guys at the lowest tranches don't want you to modify the loan, because that means losses, and they take those losses first, while the guys in the highest tranche want to modify the loan because it generates more income for them and they're not eating any losses. Unfortunately for you, in most CMBS agreements you need a supermajority of 70-80% of the votes to get a loan modification.*

*So, to lower rents to market rates and get the building rented out, since you can't get a loan modification, you, the landlord, have to write a check to the bank to make up the difference between the value of the building at the old, higher rental rate and the value of the building at the new, lower rate. Or you can just do nothing, get an extra write off for your taxes, and hope some sucker comes in and rents at the higher price or a different sucker comes along and buys the place from you, making it their problem. This is why you'll see so many empty storefronts with ridiculous asking prices that the landlords won't budge on - it's because they can't.*

*I really, really skimmed just the teeniest top of the surface on this subject, but basically all those CMBS notes that are super toxic start coming due in March of 2022, and they're going to absolutely detonate the commercial property market. Many banks and investment groups will be destroyed when these go bad, just like in 2008.*

[Video of Empty Stores in NYC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqSUhVjS77o)

*This is a video from a guy who just walked around downtown NYC showing all the empty stores and how the place basically looks like a dead mall now.*

*TIMEFRAME: March 2022*

Well, I said March 2022 was when these shit CMBS notes were going to start detonating/causing problems.  Let's check shall we?

You see that little spike at the end of the head and shoulders before it really dives to new all time lows?  Yeah, that's the last day of February, 2022.  

Ok, so that's 1/3 of the US real estate market, what about the 2/3rds of the market that's residential?  Well, this is where it gets weird, and how everyone (including me) kept missing it.  I've written before about the issues with the US housing market - housing units relative to population has actually increased over the last decade+, while homeownership rates have dropped and prices have skyrocketed.  

Everyone who looks at the residential market thinks its being bought by residents, and that all the people buying today are actually qualified buye

Ann Arbor. Very good place, my apartments are older, but that's reflected by the price. What helps is the management understands this and does everything to make things comfortable. They would repair maintenance request within 1-2 business days, and things would often be fixed. Very good landlord, great staff Ann Arbor for All? I understand that my opinion on The Comp Plan isn’t the popular one, so I’ll keep my reasoning as concise as possible and my sources cited. I hope people can appreciate my concerns bearing in mind that I DO want Ann Arbor to be more accessible for all people at all income levels.



The problem is that The Plan isn’t the affordable housing plan it claims to be. The language of The Plan makes clear that it will drive up taxes in Ann Arbor, increase our average rental costs, and not decrease the cost of living in any way. When poor people are already priced out of the city, a plan to further increase costs will make us less inclusive than ever. 

https://preview.redd.it/7q4qb0qlkocf1.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4478a8199f6c063cfdf6ee0d863894dc820387f8

Page 126 of [**DRAFT 2 Comprehensive Land Use Plan**](https://engage.a2gov.org/download_file/view/564/586) (above) is about the investments required for the CLUP. Before we can increase our population we need to build the infrastructure they’ll use. Our taxes pay for public utilities, if we need substantially more public utilities we’ll have to pay for them. There are people barely getting by in Ann Arbor and we need to make sure they don’t lose their housing, especially in the case of people on fixed income who can’t accommodate constantly rising costs.

https://preview.redd.it/1nbfi71qkocf1.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81857a1d6a2ed71565001d87c3ddb784ca450a2b

The [**DRAFT Housing Appendix**](https://engage.a2gov.org/download_file/view/577/586) (above) prepares residents for a period of adjustment on pages 19 and 20, telling us that the first housing units built will likely be above the average market rate, driving up average housing costs. The tradeoff of developing high-end properties is that building new housing is associated with a slower pace of rent increases. One thing is for certain, none of this is meant to decrease the cost of living in Ann Arbor. The argument for this plan improving A2’s affordability isn’t that it’ll make anything cheaper, but that things would be more expensive otherwise. If the goal of this plan is for a more equitable Ann Arbor, it bears acknowledgement that the first people to be served are those with the most already.



The Comp Plan’s threat of Ann Arbor's population hollowing out assumes that if we don’t follow CLUP we’ll just sit on our hands and change nothing. It isn’t CLUP or nothing. There are methods absent in The Plan (such as expanding our use of rent vouchers) that absolutely reduce cost of living, and we’re being told our best option is “associated with” slower rent increases. This represents immediate quantifiable benefits for the wealthy, and theoretical future benefits for the less wealthy if they manage to stick out elevated costs. The core of what I have to say is this: housing in Ann Arbor is out of reach for many people who would like to live here, raising the bar won’t fix the problem.

Edit: where it currently reads ""expanding our use of rent vouchers"" it used to read ""rent control,"" I thought it was legal, it isn't. Luckily (though many comments didn't understand this) rent control was not the entirety of my argument, but an example of a way the government can provide direct assistance to people. Remember, it's not about the main points, it's about whether you can find small rhetorical inaccuracies.

After 98 years, The Big House will host its first ever concert. https://www.woodtv.com/news/michigan/after-98-years-the-big-house-to-hold-its-first-concert/amp/

&gt; GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — Michigan Stadium has hosted hundreds of football games and graduation ceremonies and has been the backdrop for countless memories made in Ann Arbor. But for the first time in the stadium’s 98-year history, it will host a concert.

&gt; AEG Presents announced Wednesday that country star Zach Bryan will perform at “The Big House” on Sept. 27. John Mayer, Ryan Bingham and The Texas Gentlemen and Joshua Slone are set to join him on the bill.



&gt; Tickets for the concert are set to go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday.

&gt; Michigan Stadium opened on Oct. 1, 1927 — a Wolverines win over Ohio Wesleyan. It is the vision of legendary football coach Fielding Yost who pushed the University of Michigan to build a bigger stadium to fit more fans.

&gt; With a set seating capacity of 107,601, it is considered the largest stadium in the country and the third largest in the world. According to USA Today, Michigan Stadium ranks only behind North Korea’s “May Day Stadium” (150,000) and India’s Narendra Modi Stadium (132,000). Such a lovely property with so many beautiful, mature trees. I truly enjoy the view of the courtyard from my apartment. It’s just lovely. The maintenance team is always kind and quick to help.

There used to be a thing called punk week every summer in Ann Arbor, MI a while back, probably started in the early 2000’s and went til 2010 I think. Basically every year a bunch of traveling kids would show up all over the city and all these wacky events would happen. I went the last two years when I was probably 15-16 and it was the first time I got exposed to this community.

There was a zombie walk where everyone dressed like zombies and terrorized the town, a scavenger hunt with stuff like “find a yuppie who knows the lyrics to a nickelback song,” a giant shopping cart race where people would fly down a hill in decked out shopping carts (saw one girl with a portable stove who made pancakes on the way down and handed em out at the bottom of the hill) then lots of shows in between. One I remember was a generator show under the m14 overpass in the middle of the night (young me thought they meant a band called the generators was playing) 

The whole experience was super cool and I met a ton of rad people. Being 16 and getting wasted with hobos in the woods was fun as hell for a little 16 year old wanna be punk kid. 

By 2010 it got kinda out of hand and soooooooo many dirty kids showed up it felt like there were more of them than actual residents. Eventually I guess the city got tired of cleaning oogle poop off the sidewalk and kinda ran everyone off, shit was fun as hell while it lasted though. Ann Arbor’s super gentrified and way less fun nowadays, all the punk houses are gone, and any cool shit in that area happens a city over in Ypsilanti now. 

I gotta imagine the vast majority of people I met (including the LATFO guy lol) don’t travel anymore since it’s been so long now, just wondering if anyone in this sub was out there or has any memories from those weeks. The location of the apartment and the easy access to Trader Joe's was a great plus point the apartment, but everything concerning the actual management was a massive negative, and contributed to the reason I left after 4 years of living here

ed up abandoned gas station in the woods near Leslie Park that was pretty freaky when I was a kid. There was a bunch of other abandoned junk around there too like a rusted old bus and old junked cars and furniture. It was like a rite of passage for your friends to take you back there when the sun goes down to scare you. Legend has it some old creeper still roams those trails to this day.

This next one isn’t Ann Arbor but many know of the infamous NoFace in Ypsi from the 2000’s, the guy who allegedly blasted off most of his face in a failed suicide attempt with a shotgun and walked the streets freaking people out. That one seems to be a true story and is actually just really sad.

Art experience in Ann Arbor, mid90’s-late90’s I am about to turn 42. Graduated high school in 1999. Spent a fair amount of time in/around Ann Arbor with friends, all of us broke and all of us having a very good time. None of us locals, but many went on to attend UM or EMU. 

I distinctly remember driving at night into a wooded area of A2, maybe even with dirt roads, and approaching a flimsy metal gate with the smallest of chains- clearly not meant as a real deterrent. 

We slipped past that gate, and in the moonlight made our way to an open field. Memory has it as very well cultivated, maybe even a working farm. Can’t confirm but this feels like it would be in the fall. 

When we broke through the trees, we saw several large sculptures- again memory is hazy but I do recall one almost being made of the same timber as playground sets. Beautiful, magical, weird. 

I simply cannot find any mention of this online so I’m turning to Reddit- is this a very common rite of passage that I’ve just neglected to socialize, or did one of my friends discover something wonderful and singular? Anyone know where this place is, or why it exist(ed)? Is it still there, and if so are kids still discovering it?

- The management was also very unhelpful with any actual maintenance issues: my apartment had a mouse problem in December 2022, and despite several promises by management to send pest control, no one every showed up. Finally, I had to set traps myself, and monitor the situation for several weeks. This is despite the management charging a pest control fee. It's unclear what that fee was actually paying for.
- Finally, since I left, the other tenants in the apartment complex have been trying to form a tenants union, since they can get better responses to issues like the above as a collective unit rather than individual tenants. However, the management has refused to engage, and illegally threatened one of the organizers of the union with eviction, despite the fact that it is perfectly legal in Michigan to form tenants association.

I would not recommend living here, even though being close to Trader Joe's is a really nice perk: it is not worth the low quality of living otherwise. Suggestions for 1 bed/1 bath places in Ann Arbor? Hey all, I'm researching for a studio or 1 bed/ 1 bath place, and about three options pop up:

1. Hidden Valley Club, which costs about $1400 per month (690 sq ft), including utilities (not sure if that includes internet). And they are not furnished, right?
2. Avia Lofts of Valley Ways, \~$1295 per month (not sure about community fee). I like that they are brand-new studios (500 sq ft) and are furnished, and I was really tempted to apply. But then I looked at the video and noticed they don't seem to have an oven (only have dishwasher), which is a red flag for me.
3. Ann Arbor Woods, probably the cheapest (\~$1250 per month) studio in town. I can also get to my place the quickest. But the rating online is brutal.

I would love to hear any advice from current residents regarding the three places. And if there are any other places that are \~1300-1400$ a month. Thanks in advance!

So I recently got at job working for U of M on North Campus (NCRC building). I am having a hard time deciding on 1 bedroom apartments based on so many mixed reviews. I would like to keep rent below $1,200 (including the cost of utilities), have a washer/dryer in unit, and be decently close to work (around 15 min drive). Also decent enough space for 2 people as I will be moving in with my boyfriend. I am open to 2-bedroom apartments if they fall in the price range as well.

I've narrowed down a list of some top ones:

* Flo-Mar Terraces
* Hidden Valley Club
* Briar Cove Apartments
* Village Park of Ann Arbor
* Ridgewood Apartments
* Willow Ridge Apartments

What are your experiences with these apartment complexes/what have you heard about them? If anyone is looking a lease takeover or if you guys have any other suggestions that would be great too! I'm giving this poor review rate b/c of a very bad experience and service I've received. I recommend don't deal with this property management and look for a different rentals.
I was approaching this property because it offers a short term lease starting from 3 months lease, which was what I needed as my close relative was planned to visit us in town for 3 months. I told the office manager that this is for my relative coming for a three months visit, in several visits I made to this property. I've submitted the application online and paid the application fee and the holding fee. The day before the rent start date, I came over again, with the rent payment check and expected to receive the keys. To my amazement, I was shocked to find out that the lease term was changed to 12 months and more fees were requested, totaled in $700 fees in order to get the keys.
I was shocked and refused to make this deal. I was very upset and had to cancel many services I planed for this rental, such as rental insurance, movers, Xfinity and DTE. I had to look for a new place quickly, since my relative was about to arrive the day after. Because of this rude service, I demanded from the office manager to be refunded for the holding fee and the application fee I paid. The office manager said I will be refunded in 48 hours. I have never received the refund and every time I called they said they are working on it. After 3 months they said that the billing department confirmed I will not be refunded.

I’m moving to Ann Arbor in August as a graduate student and I’m looking at a couple different apartment complexes for my partner and I. Our budget is ~2k and we’re open to both 1B and 2B options. The places I’m looking at are: 

- Woodbury Gardens
- Hidden Valley Club
- Ponds at Georgetown

Does anyone have any experience / insights into these places? I’m aware they aren’t the most luxurious apartments but just looking for a place that isn’t super outdated or run down. Another  important thing is that I have an easy access to a bus to campus (20-25 min commute) 

Also if anyone has any other suggestions of places to live please share!

I was admitted to the master's of computer science programs at both UM-Dearborn and Wayne State and am deciding which school to attend. Can anyone provide insight from their experience in CS at UM-Dearborn (as either an undergrad or grad student)?

A few general q
...
emption arc.

Head of school (8/10): We talk a lot and he personally approved a lot of the club stuff that I did at the school. Unfortunately, he's super way high up in the school bureaucracy so I don't know if he necessarily knew as much about me like my actual teachers.

Dean (7/10): He doesn't know me at all. I don't remember off the top of my head why I asked.

Korean consul (8/10): He had a lot to say about my volunteer work, and about my work ethic, but I'm not even going to pretend like that's why his rec was strong. He was literally working at the korean consulate here in LA, and that's why I think the rec is good.

**Interviews**

MIT (7/10): It was okay. I suck at ending interviews, and it was made worse by the fact that after we said goodbye we walked in the same direction for 7 minutes.

Harvard (3/10): I called him the wrong name four times.

Dartmouth (8/10): I wasn't even sure why I applied to Dartmouth at the beginning, but she genuinely sold me the idea of going to the school. We talked for a super long time and only stopped because she had to go to the next interview.

**Essays**

I was super disorganized and all over the place with my essays. I don't believe in copy pasting essays for another school's prompt and then tweaking it, so I genuinely spent time on each one building it from the ground up. Upside: all my essays were unique. Downside: By the time Ivies were due, I was turning in 2nd drafts.

My personal statement was about getting cancelled online. I did some funny business and paid for it.

Vintage 1900s neighborhood to feature ‘affordable’ apartments with pricier homes near Ann Arbor I HAVE HAD IT ENOUGH

The only responses I got were vague and non-committal. It’s been extremely frustrating trying to get a straight answer or any accountability. I’ve done everything on my end—prompt communication, polite follow-ups—and yet the refund is still pending without explanation.

""Last year in September I was bit in the face by a pit bull while I was outside with my chihuahua.  I am left with scars on my face and a blind spot in my right eye.  I had to receive rabies shots as well due to the dog not being vaccinated.

Over the last six months I’ve been trying to find a way to sue the owners and the apartment complex.  Because the owners don’t have insurance and because the apartment rules were nothing signed off on (they are more like guidelines) every lawyer has denied me since we have no insurance recovery from this happening.  
  
I am now suing the owner directly without insurance and my understanding from what I’ve learned the last six months is that this is now the only way I can have my medical bill possibly paid.  I will sue and try to get what I can, but recovering the full amount is not likely.

I will come from a state that is 6 hours drive to live in Ann Arbor for a job, with an Annual salary of 58k b4 taxes.

I need an apartment that's safe, clean, or a house to rent at a fair price 2-bedroom. Do you think the offered salary is enough? 

Thank you. Cons: There is no central A/C for these apartments. There is one wall mounted unit in the living room. In the summer, the bedroom gets very hot making it unsleepable and the wall mounted unit in the living room can’t keep up or blow enough cold air to properly cool the apartment. No ceiling fans to help. The wall mounted unit is also super loud and runs up your electric bill

The “renovations” are substandard. Expired paint was used on the accent wall in the living room. It was giving off a foul odor. Property manager said she didn’t smell anything despite the obvious odor. The moment the maintenance worker showed up, immediately confirmed it was expired paint that was used. The vinyl floor is very cheap and wears, scratches, and breaks easily. Fixtures were falling apart. The bedroom door fell off its hinges, towel rack and toilet paper dispenser in the bathroom fell off the wall, plumbing under the kitchen sink came apart, electrical problems causing outlets to malfunction and not work, and more

Basement communal laundry machines are small, old, and expensive

Pros: Location is good and the rent is on the lower end, which is what attracts people here. The property manager is nice and tries to help. Crowdsourcing photos/stories of terrible housing situations in Ann Arbor I'm looking to collect photos and stories to share with city council to express just how dire the housing situation is in Ann Arbor. If you or someone you know has a terrible housing situation, please contact me or have them contact me, either by commenting here or by DMing me.

I'm accepting pretty much anything, but some examples of things I'm looking for include:

- Poorly maintained rentals (e.g uninsulated windows, mold, etc.)
- Ridiculous rental ""units"" (for example I looked at a ""studio apartment"" in a house where the bathroom was across a public hallway from the rest of the unit)
- Dilapidated properties (yours or someone else's, but please do not share it publicly - public shaming is the opposite of what I'm trying to do)
- Stories of the city government making housing more difficult (e.g. 3325 Packard - I'll write the story in the comments)

While I know that the situation is terrible for students, I'm mostly looking for non-student examples right now, as I get the feeling that some on city council believe it's *limited* to students. If you send me examples, please also include:

- Whether I'm allowed to make this public (and, if yes, whether you'd like to be anonymous or credited). Non-public stories/pictures will only be shared with city council members and project collaborators.
- The address (won't be shared with anyone beyond telling city council members which ward the address is in - I only want this to help verify that I'm sharing real stories and photos)

Arbor Landings Apartments,"I recently moved out after living here for several years. The location is convenient, and management does a great job with the grounds. Maintenance was very responsive to work orders. Staff were always kind and helpful. The complex is very quiet and neighbors are friendly. We did have a couple car break-ins and a vehicle theft; the first thing police said when they pulled up to take a report was...this must be the place for car thefts, this is the third one this month. This isn't the complex's fault, but reflects on the poor security. Be VERY diligent on moving in with documenting the condition of your apartment. I was charged for damages that any other place considers normal wear and tear. The carpet in my apartment was horrible when we moved in-threadbare and stained beyond belief, but I was charged for damage to it. The carpet should have been replaced before I moved in. The kitchen appliances were beat up when I moved in, but I also caught damage charges for them. We truly didn't damage anything beyond typical wear and tear (and we were three adults living there), but I'm not going to argue with the management that nickels and dimes each month, and that charges a $125 move-out inspection fee to your account when you indicate your intention to move out. They require a 90-day notice that you aren't renewing your lease, which is excessive even around here. Your energy bill will be very high and your apartment will be freezing in the winter because insulation is terrible. Water bill makes no sense--our charges were the same even during months that we were only home for two days. You will also be charged $15 for trash and $5 for pest control, which is a tacky thing to do when rent is already so much. The city conducted an inspection after a fire at the complex and found expired smoke detectors in my apartment. The rent is high even for A2 given the rundown condition of the units. Bottom line is: comparison shop and think hard about living here, and document every detail of the unit when you move in, because you will be charged for degradation that other apartments assume is what you pay rent for. Arbor Landings/Solomon squeeze you for ever dollar they can in the end, which leaves a bad taste for the years-long experience of living there. My advice to Arbor Landings/Solomon: sometimes it's better to let a few hundred bucks go, even though it's ""easy"" money to take from the deposit, in exchange for the positive perception of a years-long customer/resident when they leave. Your petty move-out response colored the entire experience as negative. My response to a post from a couple days ago... [Effort Post] #PREFACE:

Okay, so, I wasn't able to share my thoughts about the post in question since I was working. But, I see that it's generated some interesting conversations on this sub as well as Michigan-related subs here on Reddit. I think that sharing my thoughts and opinions on the subject would illuminate various issues that both novice urbanists and terminally online progressives/leftists like to talk about, and hopefully, this post reaches someone interested in shaping the future of this unique state and it's struggling cities. 

I mean, just by seeing the post in question, I feel like some of my contributions here on /r/urbanplanning have touched a nerve with those interested in radical ideas that could possibly change the culture and caliber of conversation here in Michigan. 

With that, let me finally expose just what in the hell I'm actually talking about:

##In response /u/alan_stamm 's post: ***""[Indiana is beating Michigan by attracting people, not just companies](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/indiana-beating-michigan-attracting-people-not-just-companies)""***

There's already been plenty of conversation about the piece that /u/alan_stamm posted, (who's a local journalist here in Metro Detroit, thanks for the signal boost Alan!) so, I won't relitigate the article. Instead, I want to shine a light on some of the responses that the article garnered on /r/Michigan, /r/Detroit, and here, to give my perspective since I'm the exact same demographic that this state (and it's cities) are trying so desperately to appeal to (young, twenty-something with a college education). 

Since, by default, Reddit is the world's largest blog, I feel like centralizing some of the responses to this piece on ***this*** sub and giving my perspective will give exposure to Left-Municipalist thought and theory as this line of thought is seriously devoid of adherents in Michigan's mainstream publications and it's urbanists. 

There was a time where progressives/reformers controlled and flexed political muscle to create better cities. We're a long way off from reformers being in positions of power now, but, there's no reason why Midwesterners shouldn't be in the driver's seat of political thought yet again. 

To me, the time is at hand for the Rust Belt to shed it's paternalistic and elitist thinking/culture to make way for those who think outside of the box and want the tenants of Municipalism to be reflected in their cities

So, let's get it cracking!

###(1) /r/Michigan 

So, unfortunately, it seems like the Michigan sub had the worst reception to the article out of all the subs (It's currently sitting at zero post karma). Let's see what some posters had to say about the article and I'll give my commentary as we go along:

&gt; [+36] As someone who moved to Indiana for 6 months and then promptly came back… I can’t imagine why anyone would want to live there.
&gt;&gt;[+44] I can totally see why someone would love to move to Indiana. How about someone who has been called stupid or slow their whole life and told they wouldn't amount to anything. That person could move to Indiana and probably be elected mayor of a medium sized town, for example.

&gt; [+88] Are people willing to move to Indiana really the kind of people we want in Michigan anyway?

kup truck experience engine trouble and radio interference. As they begin to check the engine, a bright white disk-shaped object approaches and shines a bluish beam directly at them. After a moment, it flies away. Once the object disappears, their truck starts right up, and the men leave to notify the police. Later, an Air Force investigation analyzes their story along with fifteen similar reports, and concludes that ball lightning phenomena is responsible. Serling warns that this may not be the only explanation.

The next section, detailing historical records, opens with Meredith reading from the Book of Ezekiel 1:4-28, which seems to provide an account of creatures who came down from the sky in a ball of fire; each with four faces, four wings, and calf-like feet, then rose back into the sky. Serling describes other ancient religious texts from Greeks and Romans about ""phantom chariots,"" and that during the reign of Charlemagne accounts of ""tyrants of the air"" concerned the ruler so greatly that anyone reporting such aerial objects was to be put to death. Other historical examples include sightings in Leon, Spain; and an incident 1887 aboard a ship called the S.S. Siberian. Starting in the late 1890s, sightings of a ""flying cigar"" were reported across the U.S., including Oakland, CA, and Denver, CO.

A young Dr. Jacques Vallée then attempts to dispel the notion that UFO sightings were limited to the United States. He describes a wave of sightings that occurred in the late 1940s and 1950s in Scandinavia, Mexico, the Soviet Union, China, and the western coast of Africa. In 1973, a team led by a Jean Balgou of the Astrophysical Institute flew in a Concorde jet packed with scientists. At high altitude in the midst of a total eclipse, he uses a stop motion camera to photograph the sun rising over the horizon, and captured a suspicious object. While NASA takes no official position on the existence of UFOS, several astronauts on the Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions have come forward with their own unexplainable observations and photographs.

Analyzed next are reports from former military officials and scientists. According to testimony from former U.S. Air Force officials, the Department of Defense first became interested in the UFO phenomenon in the late 1940s, concerned that it may constitute a military threat from a foreign power. The Air Force began a formal investigation under Project Sign which after only two weeks was complicated by the death of airman Capt. Mantell, an experienced pilot who crashed under suspicious circumstances outside Louisville, Kentucky. Public pressure was growing for answers, but the results of the investigation were classified and later squashed by USAF General Hoyt Vandenberg due to insufficient evidence. Several UFOs recorded by radar over the US capital reportedly were important enough for President Harry S. Truman to request being personally informed on all developments in the case. An F-94 intercept over Washington, D.C. caused all unknown radar signs to disappear once the fighters entered the city. As the fighters left DC airspace, the unknown objects reappeared. The confusion resulted in ""the largest, and longest, press conference in the Pentagon since World War II."" The radar issues were blamed on temperature inversion.

On January 14, 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency became involved, convening a panel of top scientists to further explore the phenomenon and its potential threat to national security. Their analysis concluded that the objects involved in several high-profile sightings were not aircraft, balloons, birds, ""but that they were self-luminous, unidentified objects."" Yet the panel found that they were indeed birds - being unidentified, they could be nothing else.

In 1966, an incident outside Ann Arbor pushes U.S. Representative Gerald Ford to set up a congressional hearing on UFOS, and it is opened by L. Mendel Rivers at the House Armed Services Committee.

Several unexplained animal mutilations of livestock are examined. While the official explanation is usually predation, interviews with ranchers suggest that they were not the result of predatory animals. The incisions in the animals do not conform to those made by steel tools, seemingly ruling out human behavior.

The film's conclusion begins with a brief overview of possible aircraft shapes, and a number of illustrations of extraterrestrials featured from Emenegger's book. A roundtable discussion featuring several of the film's scientists revolves around the hubris of mankind in believing we are the only sentient life in the universe.
Finally, a dramatized scenario of what may have occurred at Holloman Air Force Base is told by Serling.[6] Three unidentified objects are detected approaching Holloman. Base Command contacts Edwards AFB, and try to attempt contact with the objects without success. A red alert is sounded, and fighters take off. A helicopter with a professional photographer aboard was in the air, and shot several feet of film. One of the crafts break away, and seems to attempt a landing. A crew on the ground runs off several hundred more feet of film. The vehicle hovers silently perhaps ten feet off the ground before landing on three extension pads. Several Air Force officials and scientists at the base await outside as the craft's panel opens:

""Stepping forward, are one, then two, and a third of what appear to be men, dressed in tight-fitting jumpsuits. Perhaps short, by our standards. With an odd blue-grey complexion, eyes set far apart, a large pronounced nose, they wear a headpiece that resembles a rope-like design. The commander and two scientists step forward to greet the visitors. Arrangements are made by some sort of communication, and the group quickly retires to an inner office in the 'King 1' area. Left behind stand a stunned group of military personnel. Who the visitors are, and where they're from, and what they want, is unknown.""

Arbor Village Apartments,"The move in was very seamless and Tori was a great help too with me being able to settle in at Ann Arbor. They had a maintenance guy show up on the same day I moved in also when I asked for some help about an appliance in my apartment. It's also a nice layout for the complex to take your dog out and have them do their business. I can tell I'll have a good time living here already. Renting in A2 questions - from a newbie. I'm very excited to be moving to Ann Arbor in the late summer so I can begin my grad program! I'm leaving sunny CA, but have visited and love Ann Arbor for its charms.  I have filled out an application for a large studio apartment within a house near State/Packard.  I mulled the idea of living further from campus in something like Arbor Village, but this place seems to be an equal deal and closer to campus.  It's run by Arch, and they have horrible reviews, but it seems like most property management cos in the area do.  Maybe I'm missing something? What is living near that area of campus like?  Any general tips for housing? Thanks : ) Excellent landlords for the last year! Extremely quick maintenance, reasonable apartment pricing, and a very nice (to my standards atleast) apartment! Tore is always extremely helpful as well and the leasing office is quite cozy.

(Full disclosure that I wrote this review after going to a property pool party so the free tacos are definitely influencing me in some fashion here but I've had a genuinely great time renting from them!) A look at what's to come The Cards Against Humanity card lab has been updated, and with it, a whopping 800+ new cards to try out. I've managed to compile many of them here, though there are no doubt a few lurking around that I missed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Noticeably, there are no new black cards. Additionally, some of the cards appear to be slight updates of cards from past decks, or match themes from earlier packs. This, and the content of the cards, leads me to believe that there are a couple of possible scenarios for this batch of new cards, with more than one scenario being able to occur simultaneously:

1. Existing sets are about to get a massive white card card update.
2. An all-new white card box is on the way.
3. An all-new absurd box is on the way.
4. A Catholicism or Christianity pack may be in the works. 
5. A prison/crime pack may be in the works.
6. Another America/politics pack may be in the works.
7. There are new black cards, but they haven't been added to the card lab yet in order to reduce testing variables.

&amp;#x200B;

In any event, don't expect all or even most of these cards to become reality. You'll notice a lot of cards share a premise or one or two words with one another, and usually these get narrowed down to the best of the batch during the testing process. There are also a fair amount of cards that aren't quite good yet, that will likely be cut or change. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The new cards are as follows:**

Avant Apartments,"We have loved living here! The staff and our neighbors have been so friendly, and are always willing to help. Our dog also loves the dog park! It’s so nice to have a place for her to run off some energy :) I highly recommend if you’re a young professional looking for a place to call home! Moving to A2 – Looking for Apartment Recommendations 
Hey everyone,

I’m relocating to Ann Arbor in about a month and am currently searching for a 1B/1B apartment. I’m new to the area and would love some feedback! I’m looking for a renovated or newer complex with a clean kitchen and bathroom. So far, I’ve been considering Avant and Uptown—does anyone have any feedback on these places? Or are there other complexes you’d recommend?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
Maximum of 2100 monthly rent. This apartment community is genuinely a great place to live. The property is always clean, quiet, and well taken care of, and the location couldn’t be better. What truly sets this place apart is the management team—they’re consistently friendly, responsive, and professional. Andrew, the general manager, deserves special recognition for always being attentive and going the extra mile.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great home. EV TW: [Cadillac Celestiq], Ann Arbor, MI. $340,000 starting price. Anyone know how many of these exist rn? My boyfriend and I were deciding between a couple of apartments and decided to move in to Avant a couple months ago. Moving was seamless, the leasing office is one of the kindest and most knowledgeable I have seen (shout out to Nick and Andrew).

The apartments are beautiful, well insulated, parking is readily available and the neighborhood is always kept clean.

I would recommend this complex to anyone! [Artist Spotlight] - Kim Gordon [Kim Gordon](https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTU5MjM3Njc3NzMwNzY4NDgw/gettyimages-481672115.jpg)

A musician, visual artist, and writer who questions consumerism and women's place in society with a keen eye and poetic detail, Kim Gordon first came to prominence as the bassist/vocalist for Sonic Youth. During her time with that band, her smoky, half-spoken, half-sung vocals and feminist viewpoint added depth to their experimental rock and made her a major figure on the American indie rock scene from the '80s onward. A small handful of her standout moments include ""Shadow of a Doubt"" from 1986's EVOL; the Karen Carpenter homage ""Tunic"" and Chuck D collaboration ""Kool Thing"" from 1990's Goo; and the Kim Deal duet ""Little Trouble Girl"" from 1995's Washing Machine. In addition, she made a name for herself as an inventive collaborator with Pussy Galore's Julia Cafritz as Free Kitten and in projects with artists such as Ikue Mori and Yoko Ono that strengthened her ties to the avant-garde. Her work as a fashion designer and producer also hinted at the breadth of her talent; after Sonic Youth disbanded in 2011, she branched out even further. Gordon pursued the career as a visual artist that she put on hold while changing the sound of underground rock, and became a best-selling author with her 2015 memoir Girl in a Band. With guitarist Bill Nace, she dove into the most free-form side of her music as Body/Head on exploratory albums including 2018's The Switch. Four decades after she began making music, her 2019 solo debut, No Home Record, proved her juxtapositions of subversive commentary with experimental and pop sounds were as trenchant as ever.

Born in Rochester, New York, on April 28, 1953, Kim Gordon moved to Los Angeles at age five, when her sociology professor father took a job at UCLA. While growing up, she attended University Elementary School and University High School, both of which were progressive institutions associated with UCLA. After completing high school, Gordon studied at Santa Monica College for a couple of years before she transferred to Toronto's York University. In 1974, while in Toronto, Gordon formed a short-lived band with fellow art students, but the group broke up after a single show at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. However, being so far away from home -- and the California sunshine -- wore on her, so she returned and enrolled in L.A.'s Otis Art Institute, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1977.

To follow her dream of becoming a visual artist, Gordon moved to New York City in 1980. Along with making herself a fixture of the city's art scene -- she wrote articles for Artforum and worked for the art dealer Larry Gagosian -- she also immersed herself in New York's no wave music scene. Emboldened by no wave's eagerness to crush accepted musical boundaries -- and having just come into possession of a well-worn guitar -- Gordon partnered with Christine Hahn and Stanton Miranda to form the band CKM. It was through Miranda that she met fellow aspiring noise musician Thurston Moore; the pair began dating (and eventually married in 1984). They soon made their partnership creative as well as romantic: with guitarist Lee Ranaldo, Gordon and Moore formed Sonic Youth in 1981. When drummer Steve Shelley joined in 1986, the lineup of one of alternative rock's most influential bands was complete.

Sonic Youth became an underground institution, releasing 22 studio albums between 1982 and 2009. Gordon's bass playing, aloof-yet-fierce vocals, and songwriting -- which dealt with feminism in both practical and abstract terms -- were as fundamental to the band's music as their inventive use of alternate tunings, dissonance, and feedback and subversive use of pop melodies and hooks. As Sonic Youth's popularity crested in the late '80s and '90s thanks to acclaimed albums like 1988's Daydream Nation, 1990's Goo, and 1992's Dirty, Gordon branched out into other projects. She published magazine pieces that included a tour diary entitled ""Boys Are Smelly"" that ran in The Village Voice in 1988, and an inter

Debunking NIMBY arguments opposing development at 2525 Ann Arbor-Saline Saw the post earlier discussing the proposed development at 2525 Ann Arbor-Saline (next to the Whole Foods) and thought I’d share/debunk the NIMBY flyers I saw being hung around the area. They claim the project is not affordable (how many affordable units are on the empty field of grass?), not multi-family because it will contain studio, 1BR, and 2BR units (those are in incredibly high demand), will “destroy existing businesses” (it is an empty, unmaintained lot), will be a “renter’s hotel for sporting events” (it’s literally an apartment complex?), will “add to existing traffic congestion” (I live a block away, the traffic is fine), and will “harm the safety of our residential community” (we get it, slightly poorer people scare you). 

I included a picture of the lot they are fighting to preserve for good measure. If you’re worried about the loss of green space (not really that green), keep in mind there is a lovely park right across the street. If we can’t build apartments on literally empty lots near popular retail locations, how can we ever expect to solve the housing crisis? We have loved living here! The staff and our neighbors have been so friendly, and are always willing to help. Our dog also loves the dog park! It’s so nice to have a place for her to run off some energy :) I highly recommend if you’re a young professional looking for a place to call home! 19-story South U high-rise approved for development in Ann Arbor https://preview.redd.it/3ys1z3juzcne1.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5667377df3b85584b329afdf33fff97f086cfc1

ANN ARBOR, MI — A 19-story high-rise is slated for development along South University Avenue in Ann Arbor.

The city’s Planning Commission voted unanimously Tuesday, March 4, to OK plans for the project at the northeast corner of South U and Church Street and to recommend City Council approve a development agreement requiring a $118,125 developer contribution to the city’s parks fund.

The new high-rise is expected to bring 183 new apartments with 625 beds catering to University of Michigan students, plus 4,332 square feet of new ground-floor retail space.

It will rise just to the west of University Towers, which was built in the 1960s, and replace a mix of single-story commercial spaces and vacant lots where the old Middle Earth shop and Safe Sex Store were demolished several years ago.

CRG, which has a regional office in Chicago, is leading the development venture dubbed Chapter, which also includes Shapack Partners and Hughes Properties.

The proposed apartment mix for the building includes everything from studios to five-bedroom units.

“The unit mix is great and the mix within the floors is great,” Commissioner Sara Hammerschmidt said.

While there’s a 150-foot height cap along South U under current zoning, the developer is being granted a 30% height bonus to go up to 195 feet for including sustainability features. That includes solar panels covering at least 60% of the building footprint and making it an all-electric building, including a water-source heat pump system, though it will have a backup gas generator.

Building amenities include a fitness center, social areas and a rooftop terrace.

No car parking is proposed, but plans call for over 80 bicycle parking spaces.

New sidewalks and reconstruction of the pedestrian corridors along Church Street and South U also are planned.

“I kind of like the pedestrian part,” Commissioner Sarah Mills said, saying it’s clever and will break up what it looks like on the street, and she thinks the building is attractive.

The remaining buildings to be demolished for the project have been home to several businesses, including the Oasis Mediterranean Grill, the Motivation clothing shop, the Sweeting boba tea cafe and a Jimmy John’s sandwich shop.

Another 18-story high-rise is proposed to replace the Galleria Mall and Pinball Pete’s across the street. This apartment community is genuinely a great place to live. The property is always clean, quiet, and well taken care of, and the location couldn’t be better. What truly sets this place apart is the management team—they’re consistently friendly, responsive, and professional. Andrew, the general manager, deserves special recognition for always being attentive and going the extra mile.
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great home. Moving to Ann Arbor- with 58k salary Hi-

g the excitement to gain publicity. Don't stand a chance on their own. Unfortunately Police have a duty to protect. But too many more counter protestors to those Nazis and you can bet.

&gt;This is just sad, and to see that you are getting so many upvotes is sad.  I'm willing to have my mind changed. Why is anarchy even remotely a good idea? Why are all cops bad, and not one singular good cop exists?
&gt;&gt;If a cop doesn't try to correct the system they're in they are bastards, the system of policing makes cops bastards through it's subservience to white supremacist ideals and the protection of capital. Anarchy doesn't mean society doesn't create a manner of regulation it just means the state doesn't communities should be able to establish their own methods of policing ideally through democratic methods. You could also watch the video they're literally protecting fascists.
&gt;&gt;&gt;""it's subservience to white supremacist ideals a"" 12.5 percent of the population is responsible for over 50 percent of the homicides in the U.S.  Can you help me find the white supremacy?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;42 percent of cops beat their families. Why does crime happen?

&gt;All of those who work forces, are the same that burn crosses.
&gt;&gt;That doesn't even make sense.  You know there's cops of color and minority races right?
&gt;&gt;&gt;You know Uncle Tom's existed even when we had literal slaves, right?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So every minority cop is an Uncle Tom now? That's pretty racist of you.

&gt;Why is it sad to see the police upholding the First Amendment?
&gt;&gt;That's not the first amendment. Look it up.
&gt;&gt;&gt;That is the First Amendment. They have a right to stand there and demonstrate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No it isn't. The first amendment protects American citizens' free speech from government censorship.  It does not guarantee that the government will protect a citizen's free speech from other citizens.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually yes it does. Because if one citizen infringed on another's First Amendment rights by physical violence, they will be charged with a crime and opened up to lawsuits.

&gt;Freedom of speech and expression
&gt;&gt;Until you promote an idea that takes away said freedom.
&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no exception in the first amendment for any idea. All citizens have freedom of speech.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And other citizens have the right to disagree with that speech. Getting beaten up for being a Nazi isn’t the government arresting you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You do not have the right to beat someone up because you disagree with them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, there comes a point where you do, when those people are attempting to hurt you. People opposing nazis are not the same as nazis. Tolerance paradox and all that... Exceptional Property Manager!

Centerra Pointe,"We lived at Centerra Pointe for 3 years and enjoyed our time there. The location is excellent - within walking distance to Target, restaurants, playground, public library, and shops. The property is well maintained - weekly landscaping, repairing sidewalks, new blacktop for the roads, snow removal from sidewalks and roads quickly, etc. The property has strict rules about pets and smoking and quiet hours, which are all upheld. We didn't use the pool much, but the fitness center was nice. Maintenance is super responsive!

One thing to caution and it is not the fault of the property. Deliveries by Amazon are constantly delivered to the wrong apartment. Each building has a different building address, but the same set of apartment numbers. It's super confusing to Amazon delivery drivers who are not familiar with the property and they can never seem to deliver packages to the correct apartment. It doesn't seem to be a problem with FedEx or UPS deliveries. The apartment complex accepts all deliveries, so I recommend taking them up on their offer to accept your packages and then going to pick them up from the office.

Ryan, Hiba, Don, and Ryan (maintenance mgr.) are super friendly and willing to work with us whenever we needed something or had an issue. Thank you Centerra Pointe! Avoid Subaru/Toyota of Ann Arbor TL;DR: Listen to all of the horror stories out there about this dealership. Just go to Japanese Auto on Main (or one of the their referred shops) for maintenance and repair work.

I’ve been using Subaru of Ann Arbor for the last few maintenance intervals on my vehicle because the service manager actually gave me quotes that came in below independent shops for some expensive items. I dropped my vehicle off for about $1,100 worth of work this morning and got a call a few hours later that multiple major safety issues were found during the pre-inspection (leaking head gaskets, leaking cam carrier, both front and rear brakes need to be replaced) and repairs would be over $9,600.

Given that this amount would total my car, I asked them to immediately stop work and just get it put back together and drivable again. To my surprise, claimed they already completed all of the work on a potentially totaled vehicle! I paid my $1,100 bill and picked up my car, but I wasn’t convinced by their assessment. Keep in mind, the vehicle was last brought in 4,500 miles ago and everything looked as good as could be and brakes “half worn on front and a third worn on rear.”

I hadn’t been experiencing any precursor symptoms of the problems they claimed my car had, so I called up Dave over at Japanese Auto on Main to ask for a second opinion. I was able to drop the car off at 1 pm, and he was able to get it fully inspected by 3:30 pm. Thankfully, he confirmed my suspicions that none of these supposed issues were actually present and surmised that it was just a ploy by the dealership to scare me into trading in my vehicle. He believes they went as far as to spread “leaking” oil on the areas they pointed out in the video they sent me to make it look like there were issues. 

I guess I shouldn’t have guessed that I was the “lucky one” when it came to dealing with Subaru of Ann Arbor. Be aware they’ll play the long game to be slimy and try to scam you on vehicle maintenance and repairs! We lived at Centerra Pointe for 3 years and enjoyed our time there.

The trees and forests aren't getting any smaller. Ann Arbor needs to bury it's powerlines. If DTE wont do it, then we need public power. I had a realization earlier today. If you look up historical paintings, drawings and photos of Ann Arbor a few years after it was founded, you'll see that there were almost no trees in sight. Because of logging that occurred across the entire nation at the time, forests were almost entirely cleared out, including Ann Arbor. When Ann Arbor electrified almost 100 years ago, there weren't many trees, and the trees there were probably weren't particularly large. Now, Ann Arbor is sometimes called tree town. After all these years trees naturally started growing in, and many were introduced into neighborhoods. On top of that, in surrounding areas forests have even started returning to their former strength along with the wildlife that used to occupy those spaces.

Along with all the tree growth, weather has become more extreme, and it's clear weather will unfortunately continue to get more extreme as the globe warms.

So you have trees and forests growing larger every year, and weather becoming more extreme. Growth is trending up, extreme weather is trending up. Thinking you can trim back enough trees is paddling up stream at this point. The problem is clearly not going to go away on it's own. There is a point where above ground powerlines

Budget - Budget is completely flexible but obviously saving money is better than not saving money. I'd like to buy a house at some point but I'm fine renting while doing my studies.

I currently live in Portland and love the PNW (I haven't spent much time in Eugene or Olympia, however), but I'd be foolish to ignore the potential opportunities in Michigan so I'm adding it to the list.

Any input is welcome and thank you in advance!

Edit to add: The actual university is in Seattle but we'd probably opt to live in Olympia and commute. Feedback on that option is welcome as well. I love the apartments, living area distribution, bedroom space, bathroom size and closet size. The location is AMAZING! We can do a lot of things walking and around 3 minutes driving from I-94. I truly recommend Centerra Point. Why is Ann Arbor full of such toxic coffee shop owners? TL;DR: If you want to support local businesses in terms of employee care, I would avoid going to The Drip House coffee shop across the street from the Big House.

I've been putting off writing this because I'm not one to make posts leaving a review of a place publicly, it makes me feel like a bit like a ""Karen"". Up until yesterday, I wasn't going to post anything without having information to back up my claims. And now with what awful news I've been told recently about this place...I feel like if it comes down to how employees are treated somewhere I frequent, then speaking up is necessary.

The staff at this store were formally very friendly and welcoming when I started regularly coming during the spring last year. I got to know a lot of these lovely faces and the general energy from the staff was great. But as the school year progressed, it seemed like every time I went into the store, everyone behind the shop counter seemed visibly stressed and short staffed...always in a hurry to finish a transaction so they could finish items they were behind on....Constantly yelling out orders every ten seconds....The (repetitively loud) mobile ordering sounds ringing throughout the building... It got to the point where I don't go in as often just due to the visible line out the door.

Side note, maybe I'm behind on the times, but what kind of small coffee shop has DoorDash?

All of this context said: I went in about a month ago and I asked one of the baristas how business has been recently, and the response was, and I quote, ""it's busy enough that we know we don't get paid enough for it"". Ouch. That was out of left field to hear. Out of curiosity, I asked how much the baristas make, and it felt like a punch to the gut to find out that the baristas at this location make 9.45 an hour. Yes, less than Michigan minimum wage. Excuse me? Did I hear that right?

For people who haven't experienced The Drip House, the business this shop is bringing in is impressively astounding, considering, like I said previously, there's almost always a line out the door whenever I pull into their (disgraceful) parking lot (No, seriously. This parking lot is a nightmare to pull into). The shop is also open during home games (I avoid the area during this time, but I do not doubt it is crazy for them). Being told their baristas make less than the minimum wage (which from my understanding is completely legal since they are tipped employees) is still super sketchy. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth and quite honestly outraged to hear this from the kind of Starbucks levels of busy I have seen this establishment. And from my understanding, their management doesn't make much more than the lower staff either. WTF? 

I have heard there has been many labor disputes and abusive ownership within the Ann Arbor coffee business community (A quick Google search brings up Mighty Good Coffee, an interesting read when I see people recommending this place quite frequently on this subreddit...), so discovering information like this isn't necessarily shocking to me, but it does get my blood boiling knowing this behavior continues in the area and is swept under the rug quickly enough for people to forgive and forget.

After sitting with this information for a few weeks, I come to find out from my colleague that their whole staff quit this week. Management and all. From my understanding, it was a unanimous decision between the whole location's employees, who majority had all been working there for over six months.

My colleague elaborated a bit (wages and labor not matching up, constant broken equipment, constant camera monitoring, no benefits or bonuses, the owner not knowing anything about coffee or food service himself while having high expectations of his employees...) and considering the circumstances of their working conditions I was informed of and have seen, this does not surprise me. The whole place reeks of wealthy privileged business owner trying to scrape as much money out of the business as possible from a successful location while leaving the employees to sweep the loose change at his feet.

Should've known that a cafe located across from the Big House would just be a cash grab.

Take this information with a grain of salt, I could know nothing...But from knowing these baristas and how hard they work, I believe every single word of it. I would perhaps avoid it in the future until there is some sort of change of heart for the owner here. I'm disappointed. I will not be returning to this location.

Also, tip your damn baristas. Because you never know if this is the kind of situation they are in.

Charlton Apartments,"It was nice to live here. Had a CO leak the MGMT responded quickly; only bothered by how thin the hallway walls are.

Also just found out that the two of these buildings aren't even in the actual city of Ann Arbor? They're apparently on a Township Island belonging to Ann Arbor Twp. odd. 5-story, all-electric apartment building approved on Ann Arbor’s north side Toured a unit under the impression that it would be available immediately. Then told me (after I paid $250 for the application) that I was wait listed until September! Do NOT rent here, Charlton is shady and deceptive, worst of a2 frankly Crowdsourcing photos/stories of terrible housing situations in Ann Arbor I'm looking to collect photos and stories to share with city council to express just how dire the housing situation is in Ann Arbor. If you or someone you know has a terrible housing situation, please contact me or have them contact me, either by commenting here or by DMing me.

I'm accepting pretty much anything, but some examples of things I'm looking for include:

- Poorly maintained rentals (e.g uninsulated windows, mold, etc.)
- Ridiculous rental ""units"" (for example I looked at a ""studio apartment"" in a house where the bathroom was across a public hallway from the rest of the unit)
- Dilapidated properties (yours or someone else's, but please do not share it publicly - public shaming is the opposite of what I'm trying to do)
- Stories of the city government making housing more difficult (e.g. 3325 Packard - I'll write the story in the comments)

While I know that the situation is terrible for students, I'm mostly looking for non-student examples right now, as I get the feeling that some on city council believe it's *limited* to students. If you send me examples, please also include:

- Whether I'm allowed to make this public (and, if yes, whether you'd like to be anonymous or credited). Non-public stories/pictures will only be shared with city council members and project collaborators.
- The address (won't be shared with anyone beyond telling city council members which ward the address is in - I only want this to help verify that I'm sharing real stories and photos)
- Monthly rent or mortgage
- Any other pertinent details (who the landlord is or if the homeowner owns the home, how this situation happened, etc.)

If you're not comfortable sharing publicly, please DM me for an email address where you can share. It was nice to live here. Had a CO leak the MGMT responded quickly; only bothered by how thin the hallway walls are.

Also just found out that the two of these buildings aren't even in the actual city of Ann Arbor? They're apparently on a Township Island belonging to Ann Arbor Twp. odd. Ann Arbor is falling apart. I don’t feel safe as a young woman walking the streets by myself anymore. I have lived here my whole life.  The people that are hanging out on the streets everyday, or that are homeless are becoming more and more aggressive. It doesn’t matter if you’re being a good person to these people or not their intentions are not good. I didn’t have any money to spare and I got called a stupid bitch as the person came after me because I didn’t have any money to share. The worst always happens to in the city when I walk alone. I have had old men come up to me and threaten to rip my bag off my shoulder because I didn’t have $2. Just for the record I am not an expensive looking person I dress and thrift store, clothing, and shop at Plato’s closet. 

 I am saying this out loud for any people that are walking the streets without the knowledge that things are changing very quickly in Ann Arbor. Don’t pull your money out and show people what you have if you do decide to help, and always travel with a buddy. I don’t know how to advocate for Ann Arbor becoming respectable again, or ways that we can help some of these people if they even want it. It’s incredibly unfortunate and sad to see happening in the city of Ann Arbor. I know there’s a lot more behind it, and my main point to this message is people be safe and always be aware of your surroundings even more then usual when you’re in this area. This complex gave me the worst experience when looking for an apartment: FIRST, they use an app called RentCafe that locks people out constantly and fails to make payments go through for tenants, which can hurt one's credit score. I called and emailed multiple times asking for help and they never followed through, only asking to try a different email that gets locked again. If management shows this little care for potential tenants, I can only imagine how currents tenants are being treated who can't pay their rent on time because of RentCafe.

SECOND, staff messed up more than once and failed to inform us of changes for meetings or availabilities when we were already driving over. Two times we were supposed to tour different apartments, only for the seller to say we couldn't see the place now and just pointed at stuff outside the building/room for us to view instead.

THIRD, staff there mixed up the prices and requirements for each apartment recommended. Including other details like balconies or patios. I asked if I could apply with a guarantor to meet the 3x monthly income for rent, which they said yes. But I suddenly get a call from them saying my guarantor can't be accepted now because they jacked up the requirement to 4x, something no one ever bothered to tell us was a thing they do. What makes that last point more irritating is the fact we already emailed our info after getting locked out, so their underwriter should have forewarned us at least a week ago how we didn't meet this new requirement.

All of this was irritating and irresponsible on Charlton's part. Their seller tried telling me I can wait until December now to build more income which is outrageous, because I already lost the possibility of moving into another complex this month due to poor management on their part. I would not risk buying their most luxurious apart

I will come from a state that is 6 hours drive to live in Ann Arbor for a job, with an Annual salary of 58k b4 taxes.

I need an apartment that's safe, clean, or a house to rent at a fair price 2-bedroom. Do you think the offered salary is enough? 

Thank you. Really happy I moved into this apartment complex. Maintenance team is extremely nice, helpful, and always comes on time.

So my wife and I will be moving to Ann Arbor from North Carolina this summer for her schooling. Mind you right now we live close to the beach and live in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment for 1600. 

Short question: What in the actual hell is going on with rent prices? 

Am I missing something? Mind you my wife and I are late twenties and early thirties. We dont want to buy just rent. We also would like a nice neighborhood and are looking for a 2b/2b place. Yet the prices for those kinds of places are just crazy! 

They seem to average well above $2k for a decent place. Is this just reality of the area or am I looking in the wrong places. Mind you we would like to be within 30 minutes or so of the north side of the city. Really happy I moved into this apartment complex. Maintenance team is extremely nice, helpful, and always comes on time.

City Place Ann Arbor,"I lived at City Place for 2 years and had a pretty good experience. The leasing office got better after it switched over (yay), and the maintenance team was consistently helpful and accommodating. The rooms and units are very spacious, it’s definitely a steal for the price & for college housing. Ann Arbor may never win a ""best place to work"" award I guess  Ann Arbor has been functioning with an interim chief of police since July 2022. After four candidates interviewed to be the next Ann Arbor police chief, none of them were selected. 

Now the city school system will be without a superintendent of schools for an indefinite period. The consultant has advised the School Board that the atmosphere is just too unfavorable to attract candidates:

*The district and its school board must first work to change the negative narrative currently surrounding them . . . representatives from the Michigan Leadership Institute told the Ann Arbor School Board at its Wednesday, Sept. 27 meeting. . . People would be afraid to apply right now.”*

Is the current culture of Ann Arbor just too toxic to public employees?

https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2023/09/ann-arbor-public-schools-needs-to-change-its-narrative-to-find-a-good-leader-search-firm-says.html I have lived at city place for 3 years and genuinely think that it is one of the best options for student housing on campus. The rooms are much more spacious than other buildings and most layouts have an on-suite which is really nice. Management is really responsive and maintenance requests tend be handled in less than a week. Overall, I have had a great experience living here and would definitely recommend. It really can't get much better than City Place! HCV and Landlord Issues (Ann Arbor, MI) I have a HCV and despite management's lack of due diligence to turn in the rental increase paperwork to the issuer as they're supposed to? They consistently refused, insisting that it was my portion to pay, charged me $200/mnth in late fees (based off of like $74 they insisted was my responsibility)
I'm a $0 payer.
We were in eviction court for over 4mnths due to the building being out of compliance with the city ordinances and the voucher issuer inspection. 
We set aside an ENTIRE day for repairs to take place, yet the repairs were never completed fully, including mold accumulation.
I ended up having to sign a consent agreement that made me liable for $1700 that was due to the landlord's failure to submit paperwork as they are contractually obligated to. These fees continued to accumulate despite being in court, the process being repeatedly pushed back by the Judge for lack of compliance, and their lack of due diligence.
Therefore I ended up paying for an increase that should not have taken place due to them not turning in aforementioned paperwork, court costs, etc. 

Fast forward to the voucher issuer doing another inspection, finding the repairs had never been completed, which ended up putting the landlord in abatement for voucher payments due to the failing inspection. 

They're now terminating tenancy saying that one day (I've never been provided proof despite requesting it) I'd failed to let them in for maintenance. However, it's impossible for it to be true as I was at an appointment and not even here. 

The money I borrowed from a friend to pay the 1700 is what could have been used for a security deposit elsewhere. 
It's important to note also they tried saying that I was out of compliance with the consent agreement by not paying August rent, there's a ruling from the Judge that states the faults lie with them.


I'm completely at a loss how this is allowed to occur. I lived at City Place for 2 years and had a pretty good experience. The leasing office got better after it switched over (yay), and the maintenance team was consistently helpful and accommodating. The rooms and units are very spacious, it’s definitely a steal for the price & for college housing.

I'd love feedback on Philly because i've never lived there, just visited. I love old cities and the access to museums. Also, if there are cities that we have not considered on the midwest and east coast we're open to ideas. We had Boston on the list but took it off because I've heard it's hard to make friends there and can get very elitist with the university crowd. We also considered Atlanta but I don't think we can handle the summers or bugs unless we manage to buy a vacation home in the mountains. We strongly considered Denver, but it's so far away from family.

Obviously, we will be visiting all of these places before we land on where to put down roots but I want to hear from folks their own experiences. Extra points if you moved from Oakland/Berkeley to any of these places. Living at City Place has been a great experience! The rooms are very clean, located in a good, convenient area that is very close to campus. City Place also offers a lot of space and your own bathroom for a very good price compared to other places! I did run into a few issues here and there, but maintenance was always quick to respond and got things taken care of efficiently and fast. City Place has been a comfortable and enjoyable place to live in, and I would definitely recommend it to others looking for college housing. My friends and I have already signed to re-lease for next year! What The Hell Ann Arbor?? So my wife and I will be moving to Ann Arbor from North Carolina this summer for her schooling. Mind you right now we live close to the beach and live in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment for 1600.

They seem to average well above $2k for a decent place. Is this just reality of the area or am I looking in the wrong places. Mind you we would like to be within 30 minutes or so of the north side of the city. I’ve really enjoyed living in this townhouse. The location is one of the biggest perks — it’s super close to my classes. The townhouse itself is spacious, comfortable, and has a really welcoming feel that made it easy to settle in and call it home. I’ve genuinely loved my time here with my roommates and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place that’s both convenient and enjoyable to live in. Move from Berkeley to Ann Arbor, Chicago, Philly or suburbs of DC (Maryland/Virginia)? Hey folks,

Like most others, we're getting priced out of California. My wife and I have 2 young kids - toddler + newborn. We have family dotted all along the east coast - NY to GA and a lot in the midwest - Indiana, Cincy. We'd like to be able to see family more regularly (another reason for moving). 

Weather is not an issue in any of these places - except maybe DC might get too hot in the summers? Wife and I met in grad school in Ann Arbor, MI, so, we're no strangers to the cold - we kind of miss having snow. We absolutely love Berkeley and if there were ever a time when we could buy a 4 bd, 2 ba home in Berkeley for under 700k, we'd buy it in a heartbeat. We've narrowed down our options to the 4 cities (or areas) mentioned in the title of this post. I'd love to get diverse opinions from folks who have lived in these places. I work in tech (I'm remote and can work from anywhere). Wife works in public policy - DC is a strong pull for her but we can't afford the city itself. We'd probably look to buy in Maryland or Virginia - Silver Spring, Richmond. Moving to a red state worries us somewhat though, so I'd probably pick MD or VA. We have visited Chicago several times and love it, but we're worried about urban blight (after years in Oakland and Berkeley, we really just want some clean streets). We lived in Ann Arbor so know the place very well but I'm not too excited to move back there because I've grown accustomed to having a big city nearby (I don't care much for Detroit). I love Philly, but wife has never visited. She loves DC, I have visited once. Here's what we're looking for (apologies if some of this sounds vague):  


* A town where we can buy a 4bd, 2 ba + large yard space that is under 700k. This is a long-term move. We do not plan on moving out of the area until kids go to college.
* Good school districts and good in-state universities.
* Places to camp, ski within a few hours' drive
* Reasonable public transit to downtown/airport. We do travel a lot.
* City that has good biking infrastructure, opportunities to hike 
* Tons of parks.
* Mountains or hills nearby (1-2 hours away is fine) - we're so used to seeing hills here that we are spoiled.
* Great food .
* Good international airport to fly out of - we do have family abroad that visit us often (2-3x a year). 
* Public policy jobs Less urban blight. We lived in Oakland for several years before moving to Berkeley and have a high tolerance but it's getting to us and we really want a clean neighborhood and safe downtown. 
* Kid-friendly spaces - museums, outdoor spaces, etc.

Evergreen Apartments,"I have lived in Evergreen Apartments for about 3 years and while we have had some issues (to be expected in an older building) the leasing and maintenance teams have been great in addressing concerns and are always very kind. Given the age of the building and appliances there have definitely been issues like pests, mold, and appliances not always working fully but it is generally quiet and well maintained.

A special shout out to Lori on the maintenance team! Any time she comes by to fix something she is super nice and takes time to explain why and how repairs will go. She also goes out of her way to say hello to my pups whether she is helping us out or just passing by while we are out on walks ☺️ [RF] - How to Not Sound Racist While Standing Under a Confederate Flag Twenty feet in the air blows a flag; red, white and blue. Its stars and stripes signal a certain pride to the traffic passing below. Its pole was dug at great cost to the owner, who is old and in declining health. It took him three days and two shovels to move the required amount of Michigan soil, rocks and roots. Lacking the funds to purchase a tall, aluminum flag pole, the flag’s owner, a man named Royce decides the next best thing would be to go to his buddy’s scrapyard and find the longest, straightest, least-rusted piece of pipe he can find. Knowing Royce’s plan, the scrapyard friend gives him the pipe for free. He even welds two chain links about three apart to the top of the pipe to serve as the flag’s anchors. As far as Royce is concerned this is the moment the pipe successfully becomes a pole. Getting the pole home presented a new set of challenges, chief among them was how to fit 20ft of something in 6ft of pickup bed. Royce’s 1994 Ford F150 is up to the task. To be considerate of other motorist, he tied a red rag onto the 12 foot of pole overhanging from his pickup. He gets home without incident, but the rag is gone. 

In order to put the pole in place Royce backs his pickup into the yard so that it would tip from the bed of his truck into its pre-dug hole. If it was even five years ago Janice would be upset about tire tracks in her yard. Today it will take a miracle of concentration to get her to notice. Before setting the pole in place, Royce attaches the red and blue flag to the welded chain links. Realizing his pole lacks the pulleys most flagpoles have, it occurs to Royce that he will not be raising or lowering his flag anytime soon. Maybe that’s why the aluminum ones were so much more expensive, he thinks to himself. Adding a couple of bags of over mixed concrete he sets the pole in place. Doing his best near-sighted eyeballing, he holds the pole as the concrete hardens. After the concrete sets, Royce notices the pole leaning more towards the house more than it does to the road. Nevertheless he is satisfied. His pole is strong and mostly straight, proudly displaying the Stars and Bars of the Confederacy. 

One of the first people to notice Royce’s new ornament of the old south is a woman named Hannah. Hannah has two dogs, a live-in boyfriend and a sister in California she talks to once a week. She volunteers at her local United Methodist Church even though his tells her friends from college that she is still an atheist. Once a week, on trash day she does her best to separate everything correctly, with most of her glass, plastics and aluminum making into their respective bins. 

Arriving at home she finds her boyfriend Taylor standing in the kitchen. He is eating cold pizza and watching television on his lunch break.

“You are not going to believe what I just saw.” Hannah says. “You know that shitty looking house on the right side of the road if you are coming from Clarkston? It’s just before you turn into the sub?”

“I can’t picture it, but go ahead. What happened?”

“They have a Confederate flag flying in their yard! As in the actual Confederacy. As in General Robert E. Lee. As in we wear grey uniforms and think black people are property! And in Michigan! You know, that great bastion of southern pride…Song of the South, sweet potato pie and I move to Ann Arbor!?! WTF!?! They live hundreds of miles from anything remotely Southern. They’re in the Midwest. They are in the Big Ten. Why do they have that flag in their yard?”

Knowing Hannah is not done, Taylor attends to the work before him, and by work he means his pizza and the last 10 minutes of SportsCenter.

“It’s just the laziest way to be a racist.” continues Hannah. “Being a white supremacist in suburbs of Michigan is like being a misogynist at an all boys school. If you are going to a racist pig, at least have the courage to live somewhere the stakes might matter. I guess I have more respect for the Mississippi racist than the Michigan racist. Is that wrong to say? I feel wrong saying it? I don’t know if I should have said that.”

Meanwhile, satisfied with the work he has done for the day, Royce fires up a red Weber grill and throws on a trio of steaks. One for him, one for his wife, and one for a black lab named Wally, but whose full given name is Stone Wally Jackson. All three steaks will be served well done, with a side a microwavable fries and cold ketchup.

“You know”, Hannah says, “I’ve always had this fantasy about telling a racist piece of shit off to his or her face. What do you think I should say? Not saying I will confront them, but if I did, what would it be? What would you say?”

Still mostly into his pizza and TV, Taylor offers only slight resistance saying, “Maybe they aren’t from around here. It's terrible, but maybe the flag and what it represents really is just a part of their culture?”

“Yeah.” says Hannah. “So their whole thing is that the flag is a symbol of their heritage right? It’s not hate, it’s just a part of their past that they want to remember. What if I turn that argument against them? What I go over to that guy’s house and flip him off right in front of his face. Middle finger, right in his fucking mouth. And here’s the be
...
sn't try to correct the system they're in they are bastards, the system of policing makes cops bastards through it's subservience to white supremacist ideals and the protection of capital. Anarchy doesn't mean society doesn't create a manner of regulation it just means the state doesn't communities should be able to establish their own methods of policing ideally through democratic methods. You could also watch the video they're literally protecting fascists.
&gt;&gt;&gt;""it's subservience to white supremacist ideals a"" 12.5 percent of the population is responsible for over 50 percent of the homicides in the U.S.  Can you help me find the white supremacy?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;42 percent of cops beat their families. Why does crime happen?

[Why is it that cops can always come up with a reason to arrest a black person but they are plum out of ideas when it comes to Nazis?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1ipeqx7/bodycam_footage_of_lincoln_heights_residents/mcrfofu/)
&gt;All of those who work forces, are the same that burn crosses.
&gt;&gt;That doesn't even make sense.  You know there's cops of color and minority races right?
&gt;&gt;&gt;You know Uncle Tom's existed even when we had literal slaves, right?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So every minority cop is an Uncle Tom now? That's pretty racist of you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Someone doesn't know what racism is.

[Looks like bodycam footage of police lettings Nazis get away with being Nazis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1ipeqx7/bodycam_footage_of_lincoln_heights_residents/mcr85w5/)
&gt;If they stop the Nazis as police officers the organization or group will sue the city for 1st amendment violations. Helping fund their activities
&gt;&gt;Cops have no obligation to protect people, legally speaking.
&gt;&gt;&gt;If the Nazis are attacked they will arrest the people attacking them…
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They have no obligation to do so, legally speaking.

[its so sad to see our law enforcement our ""protectors"" protecting nazis.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1ipeqx7/bodycam_footage_of_lincoln_heights_residents/mcrc14y/)
&gt;Why is it sad to see the police upholding the First Amendment?
&gt;&gt;That's not the first amendment. Look it up.
&gt;&gt;&gt;That is the First Amendment. They have a right to stand there and demonstrate.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No it isn't. The first amendment protects American citizens' free speech from government censorship.  It does not guarantee that the government will protect a citizen's free speech from other citizens.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Actually yes it does. Because if one citizen infringed on another's First Amendment rights by physical violence, they will be charged with a crime and opened up to lawsuits.

[This is fucked up, let those people stand up for themselves and get them off the ramp](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/1ipeqx7/bodycam_footage_of_lincoln_heights_residents/mcr9473/)
&gt;Freedom of speech and expression
&gt;&gt;Until you promote an idea that takes away said freedom.
&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no exception in the first amendment for any idea. All citizens have freedom of speech.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And other citizens have the right to disagree with that speech. Getting beaten up for being a Nazi isn’t the government arresting you.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You do not have the right to beat someone up because you disagree with them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, there comes a point where you do, when those people are attempting to hurt you. People opposing nazis are not the same as nazis. Tolerance paradox and all that... A lot of these 5 star reviews are nothing but fake!! Here is my genuine review for living here. I would not recommend Evergreen Apartments. They fail to address repair issues promptly, and the apartments often have cockroaches. The washers and dryers frequently remain out of service for long periods, causing significant inconvenience. The charges for water and sewer are exorbitantly high, even if you use very little. The management is unhelpful and rather than resolving problems, they terminate leases. The complex also has a history of terrible neighbors, frequent crimes, and police presence almost daily, making it feel very unsafe. Not forgetting the toxic mold! Overall, this has been a very disappointing experience, and I cannot recommend living here. Cuz sidewalks are for trucks not pedestrians  This was at my apartment complex. And either it's a nonregistered resident truck or a rude inconsiderate visitor.  Either way... good thing I'm not vision impaired. I have lived in Evergreen Apartments for about 3 years and while we have had some issues (to be expected in an older building) the leasing and maintenance teams have been great in addressing concerns and are always very kind. Given the age of the building and appliances there have definitely been issues like pests, mold, and appliances not always working fully but it is generally quiet and well maintained.

A special shout out to Lori on the maintenance team! Any time she comes by to fix something she is super nice and takes time to explain why and how repairs will go. She also goes out of her way to say hello to my pups whether she is helping us out or just passing by while we are out on walks ☺️ Ann Arbor Events Megathread: Week of November 17, 2025 Welcome to the weekly /r/AnnArbor events megathread!

Foundry Lofts,"Jessica & Andre spent a lot of time showing us around Foundry Lofts. They both went above and beyond what other managers did at previous showings at other Ann Arbor MI apartments. The apartments were clean, amenities amazing, nice furniture, studio was spacious and floor plan the best we have viewed. Because of the attention given to us by Jessica & Andre along with the amazing studio and amenities my son just signed a lease starting fall 2026 and if staying for his PHD he is sure that he will be staying long term at Foundry Lofts :) [Megalist] SG Concerts, Raves, Gigs: Vesak Day 2025 Weekend (9-15 May) - Updated to 15 May, Thurs

There were constant questionable, add on fees, a non-responsive rental office and manager who failed to respond to emails and phone calls.  The place was dirty and not cleaned on move in. Rate my Profile! Applying for PhD in EECS for fall '25 session Hello mates. I intend to apply for grad school (PhD in ECE). Initially I am planning for the fall session, since most schools don't admit students in the spring session. However, if things turn out excellent for the spring, I will definitely think about it.

**Education:** CGPA 3.92/4.00 (**Top 5% of the class**) from Bangladesh Univ. of Engr. and Tech. (BUET) in BSc. Finished in May 2023. Pursuing MSc from the same institute. Expect to pass on Mar 2025.

**Research Exp**: Doing research in my UG supervisor's (also MS Supervisor) group since June 2022. **I have 4 Journal papers** (1 APL, 1 EDL, 1 T-ED and 1 JPC - all Q1). Three of them as first author. I also have 2 conference papers (IEEE EDTM and WIECON), both as first author. Two Journals and one conference (IEDM) under review. Collaborated with 1 top grad school, industries in the world as part of my research group, which resulted in publications.

**Professional Exp:** Have been doing Industry R&amp;D for one year in one of the top semiconductor foundries. Consulted and served as a part of the Technology Development team. Trying to publish a patent asap. By the time of the starting of fall '25, I'll have 2 years of experience. I also have part-time teaching experience in a university.

**GRE:** Not attending **TOEFL:** 101

**LORs:** My supervisor, one senior professor from my school, one from company R&amp;D, one from research collaborators (if needed).

I listed these schools. MIT EECS, MIT DMSE, Stanford, UC Berkeley, GaTech, UMich Ann arbor, CMU, UCSB, UCLA, Purdue, UIUC, UT Austin (I might reduce a few).

I intend to apply to schools with better opportunities of device research. With it in mind, I want your valuable suggestions. Especially, if the schools I chose are OK on not. And what is lacking in my profile. I want some information about spring '25. How do one find if admission is available at that time in a university. Got a summer sublease for this place. Do not plan your budget by looking at your housing contract because they add lots of extra costs on top of that. Managers are hard to get in touch and deal with. They don’t try to solve your problems, are very rude, and offer very offensive suggestions.

If you are looking for fall housing options, there are lots of better places around with friendlier managers and more transparent cost. I don’t recommend this place and would not come back for another year. Baby Shower venues? I’m looking for a baby shower venue in the Ann Arbor area that will fit roughly 60 people towards the end of July. Budget isn’t necessarily an issue, but would like somewhere that includes food/beverage so we don’t have to deal with catering as well. Any recommendations are much appreciated!! 

Edit: Thank you all for the great recommendations!! We’ve put in several inquiries/scheduled tours at Venue by 4M, Salt Springs Brewing Co., and Homes Campus!","**Location**

Hidden Valley Club Apartments,"I’m not sure if I just had a different experience than others here, but mine was completely negative. I see a lot of 5-star reviews for this place, and honestly, I don’t know how. I’ll be completely transparent — this is a detailed, honest review based on my 1-year stay while working in Ann Arbor. I hope it helps you decide if this place is right for you. Keep in mind, this is my personal experience — others may have had better luck.

Apartment-

I chose the “renovated” unit mainly because it included an in-unit washer and dryer, which was important to me. However, don’t be fooled by the word “renovated.” All they did was install a new countertop and add the washer/dryer combo.
You can immediately tell the apartment is cheaply done — the paint is poorly applied, the blinds break easily, and the closet doors feel like they could fall apart with one touch.

When I moved in, the apartment wasn’t even clean. The stove was covered in thick, greasy residue that wouldn’t come off, and the floors were sticky. I had to mop multiple times before it felt livable. I genuinely don’t think they cleaned before turning the unit over.

Maintenance-

I had many issues, but two major ones stand out:

- Electrical problem:
The kitchen circuit shorted, causing three outlets (including the fridge) to stop working. I submitted a service request and maintenance came the next day. I told them it was probably a breaker issue, but they kept replacing outlets instead of checking the fuse box. They ended up wasting an entire day trying random fixes before finally sending someone the next day who confirmed — it was the breaker. Exactly what I said from the start.

- No heat during winter:
My heat went out during the coldest week of the season. The maintenance guy literally said, “I don’t know what I’m doing,” and left me with two small space heaters. I went five days without proper heat. Completely unacceptable and shows how unqualified their team is.

Insect Control -

If you like insects, you’ll feel right at home here. I lived on the basement floor, and during summer, hundreds of beetles gathered outside my bedroom window — and eventually started finding their way inside.
I tried calling the office… surprise — no one picked up (which became a theme). On top of that, there were spiders and worms throughout the apartment. It’s clear they don’t have any kind of pest control plan in place.

Leasing Office -

Easily the worst communication I’ve ever experienced from a management team. They never answer the phone — and I mean never.

One time, they decided to rekey the building doors and sent the new keys in envelopes. I never received mine. I tried calling over and over again, no response. I eventually had to go through Trowbridge just to get someone from Hidden Valley to talk to me. Their excuse was, “We were on a tour.” Either they’re severely understaffed or just don’t care.

This wasn’t a one-time thing — every time I needed to contact them, it was the same story. No one picks up, no one calls back.

Conclusion -

If you’re moving to Ann Arbor, please look elsewhere. You’ll save yourself a lot of stress and frustration. The only good thing about this place is the location — that’s it.

Don’t be fooled by management’s cookie-cutter replies or excuses to my post — they don’t reflect the real experience. Spend a little more for a better-managed and better-maintained apartment. It’ll be worth it in the long run. The 2022 Real Estate Collapse is going to be Worse than the 2008 One, and Nobody Knows About It - Time to Call your Mom There's going to be a lot of text here, so all you smooth brain apes who are on reddit, a text based website, yet are still to retarded to read, can skip to the end where there will be a very short summary, a bottle of milk from your mother, and a blankie.

First, lets talk about the part of the real estate market that's gonna go bust that everyone knows about (or at least that people who pay attention to this shit or read my previous DDs know about): CMBS.  This is the Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities Market.  These are loans on commercial buildings that have been securitized, bundled, and sold to investors.  The following is an explanation of the CMBS issues I wrote for another DD over six months ago:

*The CMBS (Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities) Bomb*

*This one is a bit different from the mess we had in 2008 with MBS (mortgage backed securities) because it's a different market with different rules, and it's a smaller total market than MBS.*

*That said, the problems here might actually be worse. There is a company called Ladder Capital, formed out of the remnants of the Bear Stearns bond department, that has struck an unusual deal with Dollar Store, and they have a LOT of properties that are very, very much coasting on made up mortgages. I could easily write like three pages on this one partnership alone, but I'll just summarize instead and say these people learned absolutely nothing from 2008 except that it was a profitable scam that carried no jail time.*

*To understand just how bad the CMBS mess is, you need to understand how CMBS' work. At first glance, they're similar to regular MBS, it's a bundle of tens or hundreds of mortgages for commercial properties, they're divided into tranches (usually six) and the lowest tranches pay out the highest yields but also fail first. And now things get a little complex, so I'm going to simplify like crazy here, but this is the most important part to understand why this is all going to blow up.*

*A commercial building is an income generating property, it's market value is derived from how much income it generates. The bank lending you the money will want you to put up some amount of collateral for the loan. If rents go up, the amount of collateral you have to post goes down. If rent goes down, the amount of collateral you have to post goes UP. Now the weird thing about CMBS loans is that if only half your building is rented, you can just
...
he grounds look better even though it's fall now and the leaves are falling. I recommend hidden valley because it's quiet and a nice place to stay. Prices make sense for the area. I'll more than likely renew my lease in the spring. I've seen bad reviews but to each is own. Every PS5 Pro Enhanced Game Confirmed! # Total: 251

Hideaway Apartments Ann Arbor,"Very friendly and informative staff What The Hell Ann Arbor?? So my wife and I will be moving to Ann Arbor from North Carolina this summer for her schooling. Mind you right now we live close to the beach and live in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment for 1600. 

Short question: What in the actual hell is going on with rent prices? 

Am I missing something? Mind you my wife and I are late twenties and early thirties. We dont want to buy just rent. We also would like a nice neighborhood and are looking for a 2b/2b place. Yet the prices for those kinds of places are just crazy! 

They seem to average well above $2k for a decent place. Is this just reality of the area or am I looking in the wrong places. Mind you we would like to be within 30 minutes or so of the north side of the city. Very friendly and informative staff For rent: 2 bed townhouse on the Northside starting in July (help me not have to pay a mortgage and rent!) We resigned a lease knowing how crazy the house buying market is, and our landlords knew we were buying a house, but we ended up finding a place. Now our townhouse is up for rent and they can’t find someone to take over. There are two bedrooms (one is larger and the other has been a great WFH office), one bath (with double sinks!), and a clean and bright basement with lots of storage. Ideal start is early or mid-July.

I've lived here for two years and it's been great. Close to North Campus and easy bus ride to downtown and Central Campus, nestled between Leslie Science and Nature Center and the Leslie Golf Course so plenty of hiking/walking/nature! It's nice and peaceful but easy to get everywhere. 

Unfortunately it's not still painted purple, everything was painted the same gray as the bathroom prior to my move in. Two bedrooms, one bathroom (double sinks though!), and lots of storage in clean basement. Landlords have been great - chill but responsive and quick to hire professionals. 

Pets are accepted! Would be great location for grad students or professionals. 

https://www.apartments.com/1785-hideaway-lane-dr-ann-arbor-mi-unit-hideaway-lane/bppn9z8/ Very friendly and informative staff A close look at the story. Part 23: Geographic clusters The first twenty parts of the series focused on how the narrative of the Blacklist crumbles on close examination, and we then recapped most of what we had examined.

Now we have started to look at the story that emerges behind the thin, crumbling facade.  We started by questioning exactly what did Katarina do for the KGB, the cabal, and IF she really was a CIA officer, as it seems, what did she do for them.

But we should also look for the small, subtle elements that are consistent, that weave a backdrop for the story behind the charade.  And no better place to start, than the maps, the geographic clusters.

Places that are used over and over, creating links between characters.

For those who insist the answer is that the creator or show runner or some writers are from there, that answers the issue of why the place, not why cluster those characters around that place.  Like the issue of the shared Scott name.  It was the maiden name of JB's mother in law, which tells us why Scott and not Jennings, but not WHY two characters share a middle name.

&amp;#x200B;

* The Chicago cluster: Tom's foster parents (The Phelps), Kate, Kate's sister, Katarina's mother, Cooper.
* The Midwest cluster (Chicago is separate): Red, Sam, Kate, Ressler.
* The New York cluster: Dom, Katarina's mother, Katarina, Howard &amp; Susan Hargrave; Tom Keen, and Jennifer.
* The DC greater area cluster: Red, Carla, Jennifer and Raymond Reddington, Ilya, Garvey.

# The Chicago cluster

[the Chicago and Michigan clusters](https://preview.redd.it/2bi9u787teb51.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=727787d055ad8a8ab07fa6cc167efcb77982aa87)

**Kate is the first character connected to Chicago.**  That is how we learn of her.  Red gives Liz how to contact Kate in 1.10

&gt;*The Emissary Hotel in Chicago. Mr. Kaplan.*

Sure it IS a Hitchcock nod. But the fact is, Kate's is tied to Chicago from the very beginning, and it continues  in Requiem when Kate tells Katarina over the phone where her sister lives:

&gt;*Masha can't stay in a hotel that long. She needs a home. I can take her to my sister in Chicago.*

A sister that apparently is later on living in Wisconsin, when she supposedly enters WITSEC for providing evidence against a **Russian** mobster.  Another link between Russians and Kate's family:

* ANNIE TO KATE: *So what's next for you?  You gonna find some* ***more Russians to live with****?* 
* *ABOUT KATE'S SISTER:  But as fate would have it, her neighbor, Alexei Lagunov the avtoritet of a* ***Russian*** *bratva, felt given the late hour and windchill, he and his boyeviks could move a body from his basement to the trunk of an associate's car without being observed.*

that seems to indicate that Kate's family was Russian, or had Russian (or USSR) ties. And considering she, an American was happy to care for the baby of a KGB asset so she could go spy on America, chances are, she was also a soviet symphatizer, or as u/jay00212 calls her, Kap the Commie.  

I am still intrigued by the bizarre scenes of Kate's mother funeral.  Something is beyond strange:

&amp;#x200B;

Another character with ties to Chicago is **Katarina's mother, Lena Volkova AKA Virginia Lopatin King**

&gt;*Name's Virginia Lopatin. Married Tim King in '98. Lives in Chicago with a dog and a cat, three credit cards, and a subscription to Foreign Affairs.*

...
of similar scale and density often are built around existing parking garages, Thomas said.

“If you’re adding density like this to a new location, you’ve got to have that infrastructure built out in some way,” he said.

The developers said they’re excited to deliver 200-plus affordable housing units to be owned and operated by the city’s Housing Commission. A larger-scale approach is needed to meet demand for affordable housing in the city, Hauptman said.

“Addressing 20 units, 60 units at a time, that’s only addressing maybe the incremental need for that year,” he said, saying building over 200 at once can really make a dent in the issue.

Hauptman, who has been a major campaign donor to the mayor and some of his council allies, said he sees the Arbor South project as a blueprint for the type of public-private partnership that could be replicated in other areas of the city.

“We’ll be able to replicate this ... in probably at least five to 10 other areas,” he said, predicting over the next 10-plus years they could build well over 1,000 affordable housing units for people with incomes up to 60% of the area median.

The parking decks are a smart investment for the city, Eyer said, pointing to downtown parking decks as examples where the city has built infrastructure that supports the private sector.

“Cities are better positioned to take this on because of lower borrowing costs and tax exemptions,” she said.

Akmon said it’s a good project with the kind of density the city wants and she’d be delighted to support it, but she’d rather the new taxes go toward walking, biking and transit improvements, not parking garages that move the city in the opposite direction of its transportation and climate goals.

“It seems that the vision is cars, cars, cars, more cars,” Akmon said, expressing concerns the city would have a financial incentive to keep the garages full.

Mallek, D-2nd Ward, said he sees how the proposal can pencil out for the city. Building the garages in phases and bonding for them one at a time means the city wouldn’t be taking on the costs all at once or before the project has proven itself, he said.

The use of one or more special assessment districts to protect the city’s liability also is important, he said.

“This isn’t just about one project,” Eyer said. “It’s about setting the tone for the future of the South State corridor and showing what TC1 zoning can make possible when we plan boldly.”

There’s a lot about the project to be enthusiastic about, Briggs said, but the brownfield proposal is about 10 times larger than anything the city has done before.

“We’re asked to go into this, purchase land from the development for $11.4 million, then issue — as a city — general obligation bonds for $146 million,” she said. “And then we all hope that there is success in this if it moves forward, but the payback of those bonds is $234 million.”

She has yet to see a commitment to making the housing gas-free, she said, saying maybe there eventually will be an environmentally conscious proposal she can rally behind.

“But right now I’m asked to rally behind us building three parking structures,” she said.

Structured parking is necessary for the kind of dense, walkable, transit-oriented development the city envisions along transit corridors, Eyer argued.

“We also have to be realistic — most households still own cars and developers simply can’t get financing for multi-phase projects without market-justified parking,” she said.

Any mold issue? Very friendly and informative staff Hundreds apply for ‘affordable’ Ann Arbor apartments with rents up to nearly $1,700 Very friendly and informative staff FUCK ann arbor towing companies Took my friend grocery shopping today and parked my car in his apartment lot to help him unload groceries and chat for a bit. Came out about 20 minutes later and my car with my phone and groceries in it was gone. I had to wait at the towing company for 40 minutes for them to open the fence so I could pick up my car. It literally took them twice as long to retrieve my car than how long my car was parked illegally.

Shit was $365 cash ONLY. Obviously I can’t do much about it bc at the end of the day I was parked illegally but fucking hell Very friendly and informative staff Call to Action: Petition in support of increased housing density and diversity in Ann Arbor As I am sure you know, Ann Arbor is facing a housing shortage that touches every corner of our community—from cost-burdened renters and priced-out middle-income families to seniors unable to downsize affordably. The newly released (draft) Housing Appendix to our Comprehensive Plan shows why doing nothing isn't an option; zoning alone is not enough; increasing housing supply helps; and change, as it is, is slow (zoning amendments can make change possible but cannot make it happen).

**Rents rose 54% over the past decade—twice as fast as incomes. the median apartment rent grew by 54%.
**The median home value skyrocketed by 88% in the same time period.
**Nearly 7,000 people applied for just 20 affordable units last year.
**""Missing middle"" housing options are shrinking, even as household sizes fall.
**Less than 13% of city land is available for new housing under current zoning.

We need more housing of all types, in more places, for Ann Arbor to truly be a community where people of all ages, incomes, and backgrounds can live and thrive.

Check out the full draft appendix. The charts are sobering. https://a2gov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=14275212&amp;GUID=04E2FEB8-9CAB-4CE7-8C41-445DB430848E

Hoover + Greene,"I’ve lived at H&G for a little under 18mos, and have really enjoyed my experience. The building itself is nice and has a range of good amenities (pretty decent apartment gym, nice pool deck and grill area, great common room space that can be reserved).

The best part of H&G have been the various staff members I’ve interacted with. Kalie from the front office is always attentive and easy to work with. Austin, the service manager, is fantastic. I’ve had a number of service requests submitted where he or Gage have show up within a few hours to make the fix. Compared to other places I’ve lived, dad and away the best service experience I’ve had.

Would recommend H&G to anyone moving to Ann Arbor and looking for apartment-style living. Ann Arbor please fix your damn roads. These are all on Nixon road just south of the US23 bridge. They've been like this for a week. Entire road is just awful. And I checked to see if they've been reported, and they have, some for a few days.

I'm not even sure who is responsible for this section of road, the city or the county. I have a feeling each entity will say it's the other's, and nothing will be done. We moved into Hoover and Greene this fall, and it has been a great experience! Brittany in the office  has been so responsive and helpful with every question and detail. The complex is clean and quiet.  Any maintenance requests are handled quickly. Great place! Best “Fall Of Da Bone “ BBQ in Ann Arbor Im looking to eat some really good meat today. 

What place in A2 sells the best bbq that just “falls of da bone”. 

🤤 I’ve been in this retail space since 2023, and every single person who visits—whether they come into our studio or walk through the lobby—can’t help but stop and admire how beautiful, clean, and thoughtfully decorated this building is. The attention to detail is visible in every corner!

The management, staff, and maintenance team are truly top-notch—supportive, responsive, and always professional. You really won’t find better.

And the location… there are no words! Being steps away from the Big House and having a front-row seat to all things U-M sports, including the parades, makes this place extra special.

This building is the heart of Ann Arbor, and it will proudly be home to AIR® Ann Arbor for many years to come. Why are there several large settlements on the west side of Lake Michigan and not the east? I’ve lived at H&G for a little under 18mos, and have really enjoyed my experience.

&gt;Dear Ford:

&gt;While on the Coast you told me you were un-  
decided in regard to playing professional football.

&gt;We plan on signing a center for the coming  
season and will pay you $110.00 per game if you wish to join  
the ""Packers"".  Our league schedule is not drafted but we usually  
play fourteen games.  We pay in full after each contract and all  
players are paid whether they play or not and, naturally, all  
injured players are paid immediately after each game.

&gt;Will appreciate an early reply.

The average percentage is 6.28%. A season is what it sounds like. If a team split its games between two cities or moved mid-season, I gave 0.5 seasons to each city.

##Footnotes

1. Some teams named for Cleveland (mostly the Cavaliers) actually play(ed) in Richfield, which is in the Akron metro area. No championships there though, so this only dragged Akron's percentage down and boosted Cleveland.

2. The final champion of the USFL, the Baltimore Stars, actually played their home games in College Park, which is in the Washington metro area. Sorry Baltimorians.

3. For 62 seasons, the Green Bay Packers played up to 3 games a year in Milwaukee, so I've split those years between the two cities. If you don't, Green Bay is 13/92 (14.13%) and Milwaukee is 2/115 (1.74%).

4. Teams who played in LA County are 27/284 (9.51%) while those in Orange County are 2/88 (2.27%).

5. Splitting it up by boroughs and suburbs, it looks like this: The Bronx is 28/122.5 (22.86%). Brooklyn is 4/111 (3.60%). Manhattan is 18/316 (5.70%). Queens is 3/72 (4.17%). Staten Island is 0/4 (0.00%). The New Jersey suburbs are 11/163 (6.75%). The Long Island suburbs are 7/51 (13.73%).

6. For the Bay Area (San Francisco and San Jose metro areas), it's split like this: The East Bay is 9/141 (6.38%), San Francisco &amp; the Peninsula is 7/137 (5.11%) and the South Bay is 2/46 (4.35%).

EDIT: Formatting I’ve lived at H&G for a little under 18mos, and have really enjoyed my experience. The building itself is nice and has a range of good amenities (pretty decent apartment gym, nice pool deck and grill area, great common room space that can be reserved).

The best part of H&G have been the various staff members I’ve interacted with. Kalie from the front office is always attentive and easy to work with. Austin, the service manager, is fantastic. I’ve had a number of service requests submitted where he or Gage have show up within a few hours to make the fix. Compared to other places I’ve lived, dad and away the best service experience I’ve had.

Would recommend H&G to anyone moving to Ann Arbor and looking for apartment-style living. Best “Fall Of Da Bone “ BBQ in Ann Arbor Im looking to eat some really good meat today.

Huron Towers Apartments,"Huron Towers definitely deserves to be above a 3.9 average star rating! Writing this review to help with that.

I lived in Huron Towers for a year and a half (late 2022 to mid-2024) and really enjoyed my time there. The building feels so strong; while not the most aesthetically appealing to some, I liked the concrete - it helped keep things quieter and I personally like older stuff, it just feels better built. I heard the people on the sides of me sometimes and the person above me maybe twice? Generally though, it was fairly quiet. Maybe I just had quiet neighbors.

The balconies are so big and awesome. I had a full-size hammock on mine plus a high-top table (and I was in a studio). They're wrap around style - so the bigger your apt the bigger your balcony. Now I did have some partitions on mine, which were grandfathered in from the previous renter...I don't think you're allowed to do that anymore...that probably added to some of the awesomeness for me personally - but either way, you can still enjoy the balcony if you choose to.

Being on the river and hugging the arboretum was so nice; really felt calm and like home. There's also a lovely vegan restaurant in the bottom of B building. The pool on the river is nice too; it feels kind of like a resort in the summer! Also, the building is right on the B2B trail!

Maintenance is great and so is management. They will take care of you - just be nice!

As for cons, really all I can think of is that I felt like we lost power more than other residences I've lived in. One time it was out for like 4 or 5 days, I think. Could have just been a bad year, not sure. Oh, also it's not really walking distance to downtown - but it is biking distance. It took me ~15 min on a bike. They did upgrades on the elevators while I was there, so you’re all good with that. As for price, I think it’s very competitive for Ann Arbor - and if you value nature, I really think it’s one of the best apartment complexes in AA for that.

And lastly, it depends on what unit you get, but some of them have extraordinary views - I was obsessed with mine! It was like a live painting that changed daily with loads of people/ activity watching. Here are some of my fav photos - I took them so often because it was so pretty!!!

Happy apt hunting. Has anyone actually ever driven this stretch of Ontario Highway 11? (Highlighted in Purple, between North Bay and Nipigon).  What goes on up here?  Any interesting stories?  Also, why do our roads only go halfway up the province, and not any further? I LOVE Jurom Towers-I've lived here since 1984, first with my beloved Mom and then on my own on 705B! My apartment was recently removed and is absolutely GORGEOUS with the track lighting in the kitchen and the lovely new carpeting and flooring.

I like the high rise style and that the buildings, though much older  than some other ones in Ann Arbor, are well maintained.  The team here is extremely proactive about any issues that arise and those are addressed efficiently.

Love the big balconies.
Love that it's on direct bus line
All the staff here take pride in their work.

Good people-they take care of the humans who live here! It's a good place and a good community.

ANN ARBOR, MI — A 19-story high-rise is slated for development along South University Avenue in Ann Arbor.

The city’s Planning Commission voted unanimously Tuesday, March 4, to OK plans for the project at the northeast corner of South U and Church Street and to recommend City Council approve a development agreement requiring a $118,125 developer contribution to the city’s parks fund.

The new high-rise is expected to bring 183 new apartments with 625 beds catering to University of Michigan students, plus 4,332 square feet of new ground-floor retail space.

It will rise just to the west of University Towers, which was built in the 1960s, and replace a mix of single-story commercial spaces and vacant lots where the old Middle Earth shop and Safe Sex Store were demolished several years ago.

CRG, which has a regional office in Chicago, is leading the development venture dubbed Chapter, which also includes Shapack Partners and Hughes Properties.

The proposed apartment mix for the building includes everything from studios to five-bedroom units.

“The unit mix is great and the mix within the floors is great,” Commissioner Sara Hammerschmidt said.

While there’s a 150-foot height cap along South U under current zoning, the developer is being granted a 30% height bonus to go up to 195 feet for including sustainability features. That includes solar panels covering at least 60% of the building footprint and making it an all-electric building, including a water-source heat pump system, though it will have a backup gas generator.

Building amenities include a fitness center, social areas and a rooftop terrace.

No car parking is proposed, but plans call for over 80 bicycle parking spaces.

New sidewalks and reconstruction of the pedestrian corridors along Church Street and South U also are planned.

“I kind of like the pedestrian part,” Commissioner Sarah Mills said, saying it’s clever and will break up what it looks like on the street, and she thinks the building is attractive.

The remaining buildings to be demolished for the project have been home to several businesses, including the Oasis Mediterranean Grill, the Motivation clothing shop, the Sweeting boba

Manchester Flats Apartments,"Old, old building and too expensive for what it offers. Electrical issues, power kept going out and fuses going out but has OLD fuse bulbs instead of switches. unsafe power outlets. Plumbing issues, bathroom sinks don’t drain easily. Upstairs apartment had a water leak onto my ceiling, maintenance cut a hole in the ceiling to fix and left it like that until my lease ended — which allowed a moldy, musty smell and bugs in the apartment. No central air or dishwasher. Was ~$4 to complete one load of laundry in the basement IF it wasn’t broken or leaking, or if the sinks weren’t clogged and overflowing onto the floor. Painting everywhere including over mold, water damage, doors and hinges instead of replacing. Painted bath tubs to cover old tubs instead of replacing or cleaning, which chips away as the lease goes on.
Parking is free but SO crammed people would constantly scrape or door ding my car. Someone even crashed into my car when I lived there.

Either adjust the prices to reflect the quality of the apartments or remodel and fix the whole complex IMO The George's new building: ""54 new apartments, retail space proposed on Packard Street in Ann Arbor"" This is the absolute worst place I have ever lived due to management. They don’t seem to care about their residents in the slightest.

I’ve been dealing with a safety concern due to other residents for months and they are unresponsive. I’ve had to call 911 on other residents because they are fighting and threatening to shoot & stab people. Management said they can’t tell me anything about how they’re handling it because of privacy concerns… I’m sorry but I don’t really care about their privacy when I had a man 6 ft outside my window threatening to shoot everyone. I don’t think Brittany would want to live in those conditions either.

It takes weeks to get a response, if you ever get one. One time there was a lady who was screaming outside for an extended period of time and then she pulled her pants down and pissed on the sidewalk in broad daylight and I never heard anything back from management when I reported it. If you lived in building 1832 in September 2025, you probably unknowingly stepped in a big puddle of piss and tracked it into your apartment.

When I first moved in, the keys they gave me didn’t work on my apartment door. After talking to the community manager at the time, I found out they never changed the locks before I moved in and they told me to wait until Monday because it wasn’t an emergency (I moved in on a Friday). I had to call and beg them to send someone to change my lock so I could lock my new apartment full of all of my belongings. They begrudgingly agreed to send someone on Saturday morning, so I couldn’t lock my door on the first night.

A few weeks before I moved in, they told me the 1-bedroom apartment I had reserved was no longer available and my only option was to take a 2-bedroom. I still had to pay rent for the 2-bedroom with only a few weeks notice even though it was their mistake that they had promised me an apartment that didn’t exist.

These are only a few examples of the many issues I’ve had here. It feels like I’m never at peace here because I’m always dealing with some ridiculous issue that management refuses to address.

They never answer the phones. They are never in the office. Maintenance is rude and unhelpful. I wouldn’t live in this complex again if they paid ME. Whats the process of renting apartment in manchester? Hi everyone! My husband and I are looking into renting an apartment in Manchester or the surrounding areas, and we’d love some advice. We’re curious about what the rental process is like and whether it’s realistic to find a good furnished apartment for around £600–£700 per month in the outskirts. Any tips or experiences you could share would be amazing! TL;DR: Manchester Flats offers cute, affordable, and well-located apartments, but McKinley’s management enforces questionable policies—especially a problematic bed bug lease addendum—and exhibits harassing behavior that may violate state law. Proceed with caution and read the lease carefully.

Manchester Flats apartments have a lot going for them: they’re on the bus line, close to downtown, and relatively affordable for Ann Arbor—especially for those on PhD stipends or a tight budget. The hardwood floors and abundant sunlight are definite pluses. The buildings are old and have minor maintenance issues, but nothing major.

The real downside is McKinley’s management.

In 2025, they introduced a Bed Bug Lease Addendum with two alarming clauses:
1. They could evict tenants within seven days if bed bugs were found.
2. If they determined the tenant was responsible, they could hold the tenant financially liable for all treatment costs, including those for adjoining units.

I had bed bugs during my tenancy (not the only unit affected) and did everything possible to address the issue, including buying a new mattress and deep cleaning. I support policies that require tenants and landlords to promptly and thoroughly address bed bug issues.

However, the landlord’s powers in this addendum—even if aimed at non-cooperative tenants—are alarming. My lawyer advised that these terms may violate Michigan state law. When I raised these concerns, management dismissed them, saying the addendum would apply to all their properties and would not be changed for one tenant.

I had fully intended to resign another year, but given the recent nature of my bed bug experience, I couldn't rationally agree to all these new addendum terms.

After I gave notice not to renew, management’s behavior devolved further:
* They responded to my non-renewal notice with a single “tada”/""party popper"" 🎉 emoji (an attempt to celebrate my departure amongst themselves discreetly? They quietly tried to remove it later, but - unfortunately for them - such reactions leave an electronic paper trail)
* They immediately misrepresented lease terms and threatened me with improper holdover charg
...
e apartment - I left early, nearly two weeks early before the lease ended)
* They refused to accept my written non-renewal notice unless I used their official forms (not required by the lease).
* When I turned in my keys a week early, they tried to enforce an undocumented policy against accepting them early (but eventually did).

These behaviors greatly overshadowed what had been an overall 5/5 experience. But I cannot recommend living here with this specific management in control.

If you’re considering signing a lease here, don’t. But if you must, READ IT CAREFULLY—especially the bed bug addendum. And be prepared to deal with management behaviors like the ones I described - or worse. Housing Situation in Ann Arbor Hi everyone, I might be getting a job offer in the Ann Arbor area within a few weeks and would need to relocate there sometime in the September/October period.

I understand that Ann Arbor is a college town and thus many of the residences/apartments would be already filled. Would getting a suitable \[i.e. not roach infested\] apartment in a reasonably safe locality (no crime etc) be doable in the September/October 2024 period in the Ann Arbor area?

Thanks in advance!

Also: I know sometimes there is a disconnect between Zillow prices and what is on the ground. how much would you expect a studio/one-room rent to be in the Ann Arbor area?

  
**P.S. Additional Question:** Would living in the Plymouth MI area and then driving in to Ann Arbor be doable? This is the absolute worst place I have ever lived due to management. They don’t seem to care about their residents in the slightest.

Wikipedia claims that the main riff of 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' was borrowed (with permission) from the band The Manchester Mekon. What are your thoughts? [Wikipedia: Love Will Tear Us Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Will_Tear_Us_Apart)

&gt; The main riff in the song was borrowed (with permission) from a nearly unknown Mancunian band, ""The Manchester Mekon"", from their song ""The Cake Shop Device."" Joy Division heard the track being played and asked founding member Frank Ewart permission to adapt it. Permission was granted and ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" was born.

The song:

[Manchester Mekon - The Cake Shop Device ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvxdPqaPtT4)

Wikipedia lists two sources:

[Auteur Labels - Object Music](https://www.ltmrecordings.com/auteur_labels_object_music_ltmcd2527.html)

&gt; ...*The Cake Shop Device*, a musicianly piece written by Ewart in 1977. Joy Division liked one of the component melodies so much that they asked Ewart for permission to adapt it. Ewart agreed, and *Love Will Tear Us Apart* has now become a modern standard.

[The Curious Birth of Joy Division’s “Love Will Tear Us Apart”](https://www.stereoembersmagazine.com/curious-birth-joy-divisions-love-will-tear-us-apart/)

&gt; But the fact is, the very progression at its center, that millions of people around the world could hum at the drop of a long overcoat, was borrowed (with permission) from a nearly unknown band...

&gt; ...it’s little surprise that Manchester Mekon lived in a shared flat on Burton Road, the attic of which (again quoting Carroll) “hosted scores of rehearsals and recordings.” And it may very well have been there that Joy Division heard an Ewart piece called “The Cake Shop Device,” written and recorded in 1977 and featuring Chris Griffin on flute (the player responsible for the Doors-y keyboard part, unfortunately, is seemingly lost in the dry ice of time). One imagines the conversation. “Hey Frank, we like that guitar bit, is it OK if we borrow it and adapt it?” “Yeah, sure, mate, what’s mine is yours.”

Brohm has beaten #2 Iowa and #3 MSU this year alone.  

Harbaugh beats 95% of the teams he is supposed to and 5% of the teams he isn't.  Brohm loses to Minnesota and limps past Illinois.

Let Brohm scheme up wins against the top 10 opponents and Harbaugh can take care of business against the lesser foes.  By their powers combined Jeimf HarBrohm will never lose again.

nown to be alive. Anne did not take any of her tests that week and did not earn her MBA. Police found Anne's apartment completely undisturbed and her car and all of her money and belongings were left behind. Friends, family, and neighbors reported that Anne drove everywhere she went and that she was not a recreational walker or jogger. Because Anne’s flip flop sandals were found under the table and it has even been speculated that when she left her apartment she was barefoot, but this isn't known for sure. Friends, family and law enforcement scoured the fields and residential areas around Anne’s apartment building but found nothing. Anne did not have a boyfriend or a husband when she disappeared and police could find no evidence of any relationship problems in Anne’s life. Anne's friends and family reported that Anne occasionally went on dates, but said she had never had a serious relationship that they were aware of.

About 1 year after Anne was last seen a local newspaper reported that there was a rumor that Anne had been killed and put in a suitcase before being disposed of at the Claymont steel firm where she used to work, but police later said that there was no evidence to support this rumor. 

Another rumor that circulated on Facebook was that at a man who lived in Anne’s building on the 2nd floor was an odd duck who had a telescope that he used to watch his neighbors. Obviously, this is something that has not been very verified independently, and even if it has, it may have nothing to do with Anne’s disappearance. However, I wanted to mention it because it is sometimes brought up an online discussions regarding this case. 

Anne's family offered a reward for information about Anne's disappearance but they never received any pertinent tips. Very early on police speculated that Anne’s disappearance was a suicide, perhaps brought on by the stress of her final week of graduate school. But since Anne was on foot and perhaps even barefoot in a residential area, suicide is unlikely as her body has yet to be found in the decades since her disappearance. Police and media reports now say they believe that foul play was involved in Anne's disappearance and it’s believed that she was abducted or lured into a car after leaving the apartment to do something quick like check the mail or take out the trash.  

**Description**

Anne Denise Victoria Manchester is described as a white female with brown hair, brown eyes, and a medium brown complexion. She reportedly has a mark or growth on her left eyelid. She was 26 years old in 1980 and was 5’2”-5’3” and weighed 110-115 lbs. When last seen he was wearing denim cut off shorts with a heart on the back and a t-shirt. She may have also been wearing a gold Timex watch and a silver ring on her ring finger. Some sources report that this was a “silver wedding band,"" but according to Anne's family members on social media, she was not married and had never been married before. She has been ruled out as 21 Jane Does, including Elkutna Annie and Newport News Jane Doe. It's been over 40 years but Anne Denise Victoria Manchester is still missing.

What do you think happened to Anne Manchester?

I don’t feel safe as a young woman walking the streets by myself anymore. I have lived here my whole life.  The people that are hanging out on the streets everyday, or that are homeless are becoming more and more aggressive. It doesn’t matter if you’re being a good person to these people or not their intentions are not good. I didn’t have any money to spare and I got called a stupid bitch as the person came after me because I didn’t have any money to share. The worst always happens to in the city when I walk alone. I have had old men come up to me and threaten to rip my bag off my shoulder because I didn’t have $2. Just for the record I am not an expensive looking person I dress and thrift store, clothing, and shop at Plato’s closet. 

 I am saying this out loud for any people that are walking the streets without the knowledge that things are changing very quickly in Ann Arbor. Don’t pull your money out and show people what you have if you do decide to help, and always travel with a buddy. I don’t know how to advocate for Ann Arbor becoming respectable again, or ways that we can help some of these people if they even want it. It’s incredibly unfortunate and sad to see happening in the city of Ann Arbor. I know there’s a lot more behind it, and my main point to this message is people be safe and always be aware of your surroundings even more then usual when you’re in this area.","**Location**

Meadowbrook Village Apartments,"I do not recommend living in this apartment.

First of all, the unit wasn’t even cleaned when we moved in. They came to paint the walls after we had already moved in, and the chemical smell was extremely strong—it lasted for over a week and gave us headaches.

Secondly, the AC was broken when we moved in, and it made it hard to sleep. Although the apartment staff were polite, the response time was extremely slow, and it took a long time to get things fixed, which was really frustrating.

Many of the facilities break down easily, like the sliding door and the locks.

We also had a package stolen, and things only improved a bit after we installed a camera at the door.

The biggest concern came when we were away for about a week: we noticed marks on our door and that the security camera had been moved. Because it's part of an open neighborhood, there might be more safety risks.

But the absolute worst part is the winter—it’s freezing, even with the heat on. Our DTE bill was $200–300/month during the winter. The walls are paper-thin and wind comes right through them. On top of that, the windows weren’t sealed properly, so not only was it cold, but we could also clearly hear our neighbors talking.

This was by far the worst place I’ve lived in Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor Homelessness Crisis There's been a slew of posts recently about the homeless and aggressive panhandling in town recently, but not much about what can be done about it.

Like seemingly so many other issues we're facing, [homelessness is a housing problem. ](https://groundworknwa.org/news/homelessness-is-a-housing-problem-webinar/#:~:text=Homelessness%20is%20a%20Housing%20Problem%20Introduction,context%2C%20and%20housing%20market%20dynamics)Low vacancy rates, like Ann Arbor's, [significantly contribute to homelessness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137700902638?via%3Dihub) in a metro area.

**Of course, mental health issues play a role, but we're exacerbating the crisis by not building enough.**

Ann Arbor's vacancy rate has been less than 5% for 10 years, per [this](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Berkadia-3Q20-Ann-Arbor.pdf) report from 2020 and [this report from 2025. ](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Berkadia-2025-Forecast-National-Apartment-Research-Report.pdf)Put another way, we've been 95-98% occupied for a decade. Not good.

Luckily, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox, but they start with building more housing to increase the vacancy rate. New market-rate developments pay significantly more in property taxes, money that is needed for many things (schools, water, police, fire, mental health, parks, The Ride, etc.) but for this discussion, funds are now being used to build 63 [affordable units in Kerrytown](https://avalonhousing.org/avalon-ann-arbor-housing-commission-break-ground-on-dunbar-tower/), and soon 330 [right above Blake Transit Center](https://archive.is/g1tQT). These units are set aside for those making 80% of area median income or less.

The more market rate housing that we build, the more money from property taxes we will have to build affordable housing. We did the hard part by passing the Affordable Housing Millage in 2020 and we're now starting to see real progress.

If we ""Pause the Plan,"" we press Play on unaffordability, sprawl, rent surging, and homelessness getting worse.

TL;DR: support Neighbors for more Neighbors to help reduce homelessness in our great city! Recently, I've had to contact Meadowbrook's administrative staff for help with several maintenance issues that I've been having in my unit and they've been responsive, amiable, and professional at every turn.

However, the real stars of the show are the maintenance staff that have been over taking care of business. I've had the pleasure of having Matt, Tyrone, and Ahmed over to help with various work orders I've lodged and they're always exceedingly helpful, considerate, and above all, good-spirited! In the places I've lived in the past, I've always dreaded having to make maintenance requests because of long waits or shoddy work -- but that has never been an issue with these three. Meadowbrook is lucky to have them! LL Bean coming to Ann Arbor? I may be breaking some news here. I can’t find anything online about this.

ANN ARBOR, MI — A 19-story high-rise is slated for development along South University Avenue in Ann Arbor.

The city’s Planning Commission
...
lopment lacks a commitment to sustainability goals.

Council voted 10-1 in favor of her amendment to negotiate commitments to features such as solar and geothermal energy and increased access to multi-modal transportation. Disch voted against that, expressing concerns packing too much into the project could make it unrealizable.

A site plan is set to go before the Planning Commission on April 15, while the brownfield plan is under review, Community Services Administrator Derek Delacourt said, telling council to expect a reimbursement agreement May 5.

A first bond issuance is planned for September to keep the project on schedule, he said.

Dohoney said there will be another council work session to discuss it April 17.

Oxford CEO Jeff Hauptman and Crawford Hoying COO Jeremiah Thomas emphasized in an interview with MLive/The Ann Arbor News in March the investment they’re asking the city to make would come only from the incremental growth in tax revenue created by the development. The project can’t happen without that commitment from the city, they said.

Developments of similar scale and density often are built around existing parking garages, Thomas said.

“If you’re adding density like this to a new location, you’ve got to have that infrastructure built out in some way,” he said.

The developers said they’re excited to deliver 200-plus affordable housing units to be owned and operated by the city’s Housing Commission. A larger-scale approach is needed to meet demand for affordable housing in the city, Hauptman said.

“Addressing 20 units, 60 units at a time, that’s only addressing maybe the incremental need for that year,” he said, saying building over 200 at once can really make a dent in the issue.

Hauptman, who has been a major campaign donor to the mayor and some of his council allies, said he sees the Arbor South project as a blueprint for the type of public-private partnership that could be replicated in other areas of the city.

“We’ll be able to replicate this ... in probably at least five to 10 other areas,” he said, predicting over the next 10-plus years they could build well over 1,000 affordable housing units for people with incomes up to 60% of the area median.

The parking decks are a smart investment for the city, Eyer said, pointing to downtown parking decks as examples where the city has built infrastructure that supports the private sector.

“Cities are better positioned to take this on because of lower borrowing costs and tax exemptions,” she said.

Akmon said it’s a good project with the kind of density the city wants and she’d be delighted to support it, but she’d rather the new taxes go toward walking, biking and transit improvements, not parking garages that move the city in the opposite direction of its transportation and climate goals.

“It seems that the vision is cars, cars, cars, more cars,” Akmon said, expressing concerns the city would have a financial incentive to keep the garages full.

Mallek, D-2nd Ward, said he sees how the proposal can pencil out for the city. Building the garages in phases and bonding for them one at a time means the city wouldn’t be taking on the costs all at once or before the project has proven itself, he said.

The use of one or more special assessment districts to protect the city’s liability also is important, he said.

“This isn’t just about one project,” Eyer said. “It’s about setting the tone for the future of the South State corridor and showing what TC1 zoning can make possible when we plan boldly.”

There’s a lot about the project to be enthusiastic about, Briggs said, but the brownfield proposal is about 10 times larger than anything the city has done before.

“We’re asked to go into this, purchase land from the development for $11.4 million, then issue — as a city — general obligation bonds for $146 million,” she said. “And then we all hope that there is success in this if it moves forward, but the payback of those bonds is $234 million.”

She has yet to see a commitment to making the housing gas-free, she said, saying maybe there eventually will be an environmentally conscious proposal she can rally behind.

“But right now I’m asked to rally behind us building three parking structures,” she said.

Structured parking is necessary for the kind of dense, walkable, transit-oriented development the city envisions along transit corridors, Eyer argued.

“We also have to be realistic — most households still own cars and developers simply can’t get financing for multi-phase projects without market-justified parking,” she said. Sara from the leasing office stayed late on a Saturday to push my application through and she was very helpful. The apartment complex is a little on the older side, but the Neighbourhood looks decent and safe. The houses are bigger than usual with the inunit washer and dryer but can’t really complain for the price point. FUCK ann arbor towing companies Took my friend grocery shopping today and parked my car in his apartment lot to help him unload groceries and chat for a bit. Came out about 20 minutes later and my car with my phone and groceries in it was gone. I had to wait at the towing company for 40 minutes for them to open the fence so I could pick up my car. It literally took them twice as long to retrieve my car than how long my car was parked illegally.

Shit was $365 cash ONLY. Obviously I can’t do much about it bc at the end of the day I was parked illegally but fucking hell I have lived at Meadowbrook Village for about 9 months, and I am quite pleased with my experience here. The administrative staff are friendly, responsive, and take pride in their work. The maintenance team is excellent; always responsive and thorough. Any issues that have arisen have always been handled quickly and taken seriously.

The neighborhood is quiet, friendly, and safe, with easy access to downtown  Ann Arbor and the highway.

You wanted Disclosure.... I am a whistleblower recently ""retired"" from the inside. And you're only getting part of the truth. Hi. So I heard y'all want disclosure? Alright, hope you have time for this because there's a LOT. Grab a coffee or maybe get comfy with a pillow somewhere.

I've been watching the news and hearing a lot of things I know to be true shockingly being talked about openly by some higher ups in a documentary so I figured what the hell?

You can call me Rhea. Not my real name obviously, but it will do. 

A little about me... I spent about eight years in the military to pay for college and then another decade plus in a part of the US intelligence component that does not officially exist. On paper I worked for a boring sounding office in a department most people have never heard of. In reality it was a compartment inside a compartment where the odd stuff of a certain nature got routed.

My actual specialty is electro-optics. Lasers, sensors, EO imaging systems, the math and hardware behind how we detect things at a distance and, in some cases, put energy on them. That is what I trained in, what I did most of my serious work on once I was off the deployment treadmill. So when I say I know something about directed energy weapons and weird sensor returns, that's not ""I heard this from a friend of a friend"". That was my day job. Most of my career was boring in the way dangerous jobs are boring. Long days in windowless rooms. Iraq and Afghanistan in the early years, doing the usual mix of SIGINT and HUMINT support. Phone records, pattern-of-life workups, building target packets on people who’d never know my name but might notice a drone overhead later. After I got out of uniform I slid over to contractor work, then got pulled into the permanent government side.

For a long time my world was very normal: counterterrorism, sanctions evasion, shady cargo going through weird ports, stuff like that. After that, foreign missile tests and what you have probably seen described publicly as space domain awareness. Basically, watching dots move around the sky and trying to decide whose dots they were and what they were doing.

The weird part started when I was detailed to a small interagency working group looking at what was called ""anomalous aerospace and undersea systems"". Translation: things detected and showing up on sensors that did not match any known platform, did not behave like clutter, and did not go away when you changed radar modes or swapped optical systems. I was there because I understood both sides of the equation: the physics of the sensors and the intelligence context. You get taught very quickly to treat anything unexplained as a glitch, a calibration issue, operator error, software artifacts, anything that keeps your world tidy. You get used to hearing “weird glitch” as a catch-all. Except after a while you notice some of those “glitches” kept showing up, across different systems, different countries, decades apart. Same behaviors. Same basic locations. Same signature that never quite fits. At some point you either admit there is a real pattern or you drive yourself crazy trying not to see it. If you are useful and you start asking the wrong questions for long enough, someone eventually pulls you aside, takes you to a SCIF, takes your phone, has you sign your life away again, and shows you the next layer of the onion. 

This onion goes so deep I doubt that even after years of briefings I've been exposed to anything below a few layers. Even still most of this is purposely kept off NIPR and JWICS and is done in person.

That is where I learned about most of what you're interested in here and what seems to be bubbling to the surface in the news lately. That when I learned about what we call The Council. Yes aliens, and I suspect you're not likely to see a lot of what I know mentioned even by some who know it who have begun speaking out for reasons I'll get into later. 

I've never met them face to face. Everything I know about them is from briefings, documents, and one secure video session that I honestly wish I had skipped. But it lines up with too many independent data points to just shrug off as somebody’s pet theory.

The basic story is this. Earth was noticed roughly 2 billion years ago, long before anything walked around on land. Not because we’re special, but because we tripped a sensor. Or rather life tripped their sensors. You see, The Council is not a single species. It is a collective of several advanced interstellar maybe even interdimensional civilizations that run long term surveys of stars and planets the way we run spy satellites. Huge distributed arrays of instruments, working together, watching thousands of star systems at once, for millions of years at a time. Their gear probably makes the James Webb telescope look like a kid's backyard telescope.

About 2 billion years ago those instruments picked up biosignatures here, chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere that meant something was alive here. Atmospheric composition like free oxygen and methane, spectral fingerprints, chemical disequilibria that scream “there’s metabolism happening down there!"" you know, the basics. At that point Earth went into a database as “interesting, revisit later”.

Standard procedure for them when a world looks promising is pretty boring from their point of view. They send automated probes. Not big crewed ships like you see in sci-fi movies, just small, tough, very smart machines. Those probes come in, mostly target the oceans, and se
...
aid no dice, but told her she could avoid the eviction if she agreed to break the lease, move out at the end of the month, and didn't have her boyfriend over at all in the meantime. If he showed up, the landlord said she would immediately send a seven-day eviction notice and we'd be out within a week.

After that my roommate and her boyfriend basically disappeared. I think at first she might have thought that if they stayed away for a bit things might cool down and he could start coming to the house again. But at some point something must have changed - either they realized there was no path forward or they found someone else to stay with. I don't really know. But about a week ago they came to the house and started packing up some of her stuff from the garage. And yesterday my landlord said my roommate had agreed to break the lease at the end of the month. I just signed a new lease today, and will officially have my home back on Nov. 1.

Not sure what the lesson is... Definitely be cool with your landlord, and always *always* sign a separate rental agreement with your roommate(s) before you enter into a lease together.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** This was a long time friend or just 3 years? It’s really sad that the friendship just went to shit. Did you ever have like a heart to heart before things got as bad as they did to see why the sudden changes in how she was treating you? I know it sucks losing a pet but throwing away a long term friendship over it is odd

&gt; **OOP:** We've been friends for many years. We had one period after moving in where we had a heart to heart and she agreed to start being more respectful. It lasted for two days.
&gt; 
&gt; It may have started with her dog but it became all about the boyfriend. It's one of those high school, co-dependent, us against the world kind of relationships. She lost her license so she spends literally - literally - every free minute of every single day with him.
&gt; 
&gt; She's now extremely self-centered, mean, disrespectful, and completely lost to the world. It's really sad, but she's not the girl I knew anymore.
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; **Commenter 2:** Drugs. She’s on drugs.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; **OOP:** Just weed and booze. But they're the kind of people who give weed a bad name. Full on space cadets.

**OOP on his friend and her boyfriend's behaviors and ages**

&gt; **OOP:** Not really. It's just me saying ""we're going to get evicted"" and ""he needs to leave"" over and over again, while they act like teenagers. They're in their mid 30s

+

&gt; No joke. It really seemed like he was trying to establish residency here. When he met my landlord for the first time he actually hugged her, and put on the most obvious, fake charm act imaginable.
&gt; 
&gt; She called me afterwards and was like, ""Does he think I'm stupid? He really thought I'd buy that. He's so weird.""
&gt; 
&gt; Both of them thought they could hug their way into taking over the lease.

**Commenter 3:** Glad they're getting out. Now have your landlord change the locks the minute the end of the month happens. Your (ex) friend did you wrong in so many ways. Sorry, I know how it feels.

&gt; **OOP:** Thanks for saying that. Honestly. I know I'm making light of it but the past two months have been hell.

**DO NOT COMMENT IN LINKED POSTS OR MESSAGE OOPs – BoRU Rule #7**

**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT OOP** I submitted a maintenance request for a broken kitchen cabinet, and Jason went above and beyond by replacing all the kitchen cabinets. The new cabinets look amazing and have completely transformed the look of my home. I'm extremely pleased with the results and the quality of work. Highly recommend! AITAH for suing my cousin for 6K to pay for my hearing aides after he threw me in the pool  My family is all on my cousins side for this issue, and I wanted some outside judgement. 

My cousin (25m) has always been the golden child of our generation. He’s funny, good looking, and out going, not to mention a boy amongst girls.  He’s always loved to mess around and play pranks. For the record, I really dislike this cousin. I think he’s irresponsible, childish, and annoying. 

I have had hearing problems for years. I recently got a $6,000 pair of hearing aides. 

Recently at my grandmothers birthday party we were all eating and drinking on the back porch. My grandmother has a pool. My cousin decided he was going to throw me in the pool because it would be funny to ruin my hair that I just got done that day. I repeatedly told him to stop and put me down, in a very serious and not playful at all tone. 

He threw me in the pool, and my hearing aides were ruined. Afterwords when I told him what happened he basically said whoops, didn’t know you had hearing aides now. When I told him the cost of them and that he would have to replace them he freaked out, and said no way. 

My family didn’t want me to make him pay for them because i significantly out earn him and also everyone else in the family. He was in college at the time, barely making ends meet in a call center job. His girlfriend and him have a baby and they live in a one bedroom apartment. 

He refused to pay, so I took him to court. I won. He refused to make the payments after, so I took him back to court and his wages are now being garnished for the maximum amount, which is 20% of his total wages. It pushed him over the edge of what he could afford, so he’s had to work extra and drop out of college to be able to pay their rent. 

My family is absolutely fuming at me. I think he made one bad choice after the other, and he has never given a sincere apology during this whole ordeal. Had he gave a real apology after the incident and asked if he could wait till he finished school to pay me back I would’ve been fine with it. But the entitled little prick is digging his feet in at every move. 

AITAH? The only reason I could see me maybe being the asshole is because it’s affecting his child and girlfriend.","**Location**

Mill Creek Townhomes,"I've lived here for just under a year, and so far I really like it!

I shopped around for apartments and by far this spot is the best bang for your buck, the quality is better than other spots I viewed at the same price point in the area. I was nervous that because we got in at a great price point they would raise our rent but I already got my lease for the new lease year, and it has stayed the same, which I was super grateful for!

I haven't had many problems but anything I've needed, maintenance is quick to get someone out. And they've been on top of their city inspections this year making sure everything is up to code.

Gavin and Cass came and updated my fire alarms today after the city had marked them as out of date. They were super friendly and quick! :) Best Michigan city for a young family – Ann Arbor, GR, or Kalamazoo? My family (me, my wife, and our kids) are looking to relocate to Michigan.

# About Us:

* We want a place that feels **urban** or **suburban** – not rural
* We value diversity and a **progressive/liberal vibe**.
* **Walkability/biking** is a huge plus (thinking sidewalks, bike lanes, walking to parks, etc.)
* Access to nature and parks and **hiking/biking trails** would be nice
* We’d be looking for a 3-bedroom townhome/condo ideally under **$2,800/month rent**. We have no plans on buying anytime soon - we're tired of homeownership.
* I’m a remote software engineer working remotely
* Public schools aren't really a concern since we **homeschool** but may consider public/cyber school later if we're in Kalamazoo because of the Kalamazoo Promise (free college education)
* Used to grey/snowy winters in the northeast – no issue there.

# Areas We're Considering:

* **Ann Arbor** – Assuming A2 matches our values the most, but is it too expensive for our budget?
* **Grand Rapids** – Closer to beaches but what’s the job market like for me and is it too conservative?
* **Kalamazoo** – More affordable and love the idea of the Kalamazoo Promise, but don't know too much about this area.

Mostly just looking to get a feel for the ***overall vibe*** of these cities and if any of them are particularly more welcoming to transplants than others. Any and all insights appreciated! I've lived here for just under a year, and so far I really like it!

Mill Creek is a wonderful place to live! I have a plan: Lake Inferior I have had a good experience so far. The neighborhood is quite, and it seems like any crime that happens is posted to social media, so I feel pretty safe here too.

The home is very nice and the maintenance team is professional and accommodating. I've lived in many places and if you're a renter on the south side of Ann Arbor this place is certainly worth it.
Again, thank you for the experience We're very pleased with the maintenance and we feel at home.

[https://www.veridian.community/available-homes](https://www.veridian.community/available-homes) My honest experience as a current resident.

I’ve lived at Millcreek Townhomes long enough to understand both the positives and the ongoing challenges here. The community is generally quiet, and my unit itself is comfortable. I’ve always made sure my payments and documentation were handled properly, often working with SOS Community Services to keep everything accurate and on time.

A major part of my experience, however, has been dealing with repeated billing confusion. I’ve had unexpected charges show up on my account, including fees I needed SOS to help me get reviewed or corrected. It has taken several follow-ups each time just to get accurate information about my own ledger, which becomes stressful when you’re trying to stay on top of things.

Communication can also be inconsistent. There were times I wouldn’t get clear answers until I involved SOS, which shouldn’t be necessary for routine questions.

Another thing worth mentioning is the lack of washer and dryer access in my particular unit. The section I live in simply wasn’t built with washer/dryer hookups, so residents like me don’t have the option to install one. I’ve accepted that this is how the units in this part of the property are set up, but it’s something future tenants should be aware of when choosing their building or layout.

I’m sharing this review to be transparent about what my experience has been. I take care of my home, communicate, and pay what I owe  and I expect the same consistency and clarity from management. I hope they improve their responsiveness, accuracy, and overall follow-through moving forward.

Nob Hill Apartments,"I lived here for two years as a student at UM.

Pros are definitely the location, especially the price given the location— probably the most economical 1bd apartment in AA that’s still close to campus. Management and maintenance are very responsive. I’ve had day-of or day-after repairs on nearly every maintenance request here. The natural light was great too. My unit (I think it’s called the Delaware?) had north, south, and west-facing windows.

Primary con is just age. The AC is one of those three foot tall standalone units with a plastic duct venting to the outside. It’s electricity intensive (my energy bill during the summer went up like $40-50monthly) but not very effective. Setting the AC to 72 means that the living room will be about 78 and the rest of the apartment will be 80. I would definitely invest in a box fan for the bedroom. Another thing is that the appliances are pretty old. The oven is quite small, didn’t have a preheat alert, and the markings on the temperature knob were rubbed off so I was totally guessing at temps. The floorboards are creaky and you can sometimes hear your upstairs neighbors walking around.

Overall: well managed, great price for the location, lots of light, but the units themselves are pretty old and can get uncomfortable in the summer. Anyone lived in a below-street-level unit at Hidden Valley Club (Ann Arbor) or any apartment? Hey everyone,

I recently checked out an apartment at **Hidden Valley Club (building 605)** in Ann Arbor and wanted to get some opinions. The unit I saw is on the **ground floor**, but I’m not sure if it technically counts as a **basement apartment** — it’s one level below street level, and the apartment floor level is about 3 feet below the street outside.

I’ve never lived in a place like that before, so it felt a bit strange to me. I saw mixed reviews online about Hidden Valley Apartments, so I’m wondering if anyone here has **personal experience living there**, or **in a similar below-street-level apartment**.

Also, are these kinds of apartments usually **less preferred** or something people generally **avoid**? Curious to know what others think before I make a decision.

Would really appreciate any insights. 

Thanks! Lived here for a year. One of my neighbors often banged things against the floor late at night, so powerful that the vibration passed all the way down through the wall and shook everything on my table. Wooden floors are squeaky, and soundproofing is not desirable — I could hear people talking or walking around. The ventilation seems shared vertically between units, and I often smelled cigarette smoke in my bathroom starting from this April. The AC only blows warm air, so it get really hot in the summer. Also, it’s very close to the train tracks, which will stop you from going to bed early.

No complaint with the price or location. Good choice for someone who doesn’t mind these things. Crowdsourcing photos/stories of terrible housing situations in Ann Arbor I'm looking to collect photos and stories to share with city council to express just how dire the housing situation is in Ann Arbor. If you or someone you know has a terrible housing situation, please contact me or have them contact me, either by commenting here or by DMing me.

I'm accepting pretty much anything, but some examples of things I'm looking for include:

- Poorly maintained rentals (e.g uninsulated windows, mold, etc.)
- Ridiculous rental ""units"" (for example I looked at a ""studio apartment"" in a house where the bathroom was across a public hallway from the rest of the unit)
- Dilapidated properties (yours or someone else's, but please do not share it publicly - public shaming is the opposite of what I'm trying to do)
- Stories of the city government making housing more difficult (e.g. 3325 Packard - I'll write the story in the comments)

While I know that the situation is terrible for students, I'm mostly looking for non-student examples right now, as I get the feeling that some on city council believe it's *limited* to students. If you send me examples, please also include:

- Whether I'm allowed to make this public (and, if yes, whether you'd like to be anonymous or credited). Non-public stories/pictures will only be shared with city council members and project collaborators.
- The address (won't be shared with anyone beyond telling city council members which ward the address is in - I only want this to help verify that I'm sharing real stories and photos)
- Monthly rent or mortgage
- Any other pertinent details (who the landlord is or if the homeowner owns the home, how this situation happened, etc.)

Anyone lived in a below-street-level unit at Hidden Valley Club (Ann Arbor) or any apartment? Hey everyone,

I recently checked out an apartment at **Hidden Valley Club (building 605)** in Ann Arbor and wanted to get some opinions. The unit I saw is on the **ground floor**, but I’m not sure if it technically counts as a **basement apartment** — it’s one level below street level, and the apartment floor level is about 3 feet below the street outside.

I’ve never lived in a place like that before, so it felt a bit strange to me. I saw mixed reviews online about Hidden Valley Apartments, so I’m wondering if anyone here has **personal experience living there**, or **in a similar below-street-level apartment**.

Also, are these kinds of apartments usually **less preferred** or something people generally **avoid**? Curious to know what others think before I make a decision.

Would really appreciate any insights. 

Thanks! STAT AWAY FROM APT#2427. I lived in #2427 for a year and half with my wife, but total experience was terrible. When I first moved in, I really liked  this place because it was very quiet and surrounded by beautiful nature. After moving-in, I noticed generous amount of noise coming from the ceiling. That was foot step noise from the neighbor in the upstairs. It was over the acceptance level and even at 1 or 2 am sometimes. My wife and I woke up due to the noise. This noise was not every day thing, so we tried to bear it but it started to affect our lives and I just couldn’t stand seeing my wife feeling stressed. Few days later, the noise happened again, so I went and spoke to her that the issue happened again. She said she is going to send an email to the neighbor in the upstairs that she needs to be mindful in the late night(after 10pm). However, the email didn’t really work for the neighbor. I realized that the ceiling is thin and poorly sound-proofed. I knew that I will be living here for a year and half so we didn’t want to hassle for moving out and finding the new place because I didn’t do anything wrong. When I realized that the ceiling is poor, I told her that you have to do something to resolve this issue. They didn’t take it seriously and what they told me was that they warned the neighbors. After the new manager is assigned to Oak cliff, I reached out to the new manager to explain the situation and she was not supportive AT ALL. One day, the neighbor in the upstairs had a party in the late night and of course, I could hear so many noises. So I emailed her that not only me but also my wife is also suffering from the noise. What she replied to me was this. “XXXX informed me that your wife was making the complaint about the noise. Since your wife is not on the lease technically, she is not a resident here and I can't go by the complaint that she is making because she is not supposed to be living in the apartment without being on the lease. In that regard, I understand that you will be moving out in December, but it is technically a violation of your lease to have someone living in your home without them being on the lease.” I was speechless and pissed off with this message. I have mentioned multiple times that I have my wife living in the same apartment together, but no one in the office ever mentioned anything or cared. And all of sudden, the manager said this to me. It has nothing to do with the noise issue. I really hated that she mocked me for something while putting her own issue aside. Very disrespectful to me and my wife. Whenever I hear similar noises, I always remember this experience and my chest feels squeezed. It’s just so sad that my life experience in Michigan could have been much better, but due to the poorly soundproofed apartment and cold-blooded respond from the manager, it left some bitter memory in my mind. In conclusion, if you are going to live in 2nd floor or don’t get the noise issue, you are going to love it. Nice residents, clean club house and cozy place. And also, assistants in the office are all very nice and kind. Don’t get me wrong. I would have loved the apartment if there was no noise issue.  just stay away from #2427 and possibly all the residents located in the first floor. I will attache the video of the actual noise from the upstairs. No one needs to have a same experience that I had. I hope Oakcliff sees this one day and realize how terrible it was and does something to resolve the issue to make it perfect place.

Ann Arbor, Michigan: The unlikely Metro Detroit city and college town that has rapidly become a magnet for Gen Z, as 36% of its 133,000 residents are apart of the age group. The city also holds Americas largest Football Stadium. Dozens of apartment buildings are in the works as the city contributes to Detroits increasing housing prices, which are the fastest rising in the country. I’ve been a resident at Oakcliff for nearly two years, and I have enjoyed being part of the community. The maintenance team has consistently been attentive and accommodating, always mindful of the busy schedules of the residents.

I recently relocated to a different unit within Oakcliff and have had several interactions with the maintenance crew due to a few broken appliances and minor work orders. As I have a small dog and a full-time job, coordinating a time during working hours to be home for repairs can be challenging. However, the maintenance team has been extremely helpful and efficient, ensuring timely repairs despite the scheduling difficulties.

Both Justin and Amanda have been exceptional in managing these situations and turning potentially frustrating experiences into smooth resolutions.

It appears that there is a high turnover rate among the leasing office staff, which often results in short staffing. This may contribute to delayed responses and instances where incorrect information is provided to residents. While I understand staffing challenges, there is always room for improvement in communication. As the leasing office staff plays a key role in sales and customer service, I hope they recognize that their interactions with residents directly reflect the property’s reputation.

I can also confirm that the noise complaint mentioned prior to this review is valid. I share the same concerns as previous tenant and have had a similar experience. As a result, I took the initiative to address the issue directly with my upstairs neighbor, providing furniture pads and sound-dampening slippers in an effort to reduce the noise.

Snow tires in Ann Arbor I’ll be moving to Ann Arbor early next year and will have a FWD car with all-season tires. Growing up in Maryland, we had FWD and AWD cars with all-seasons and never used snow tires.
Should I be fine with all-seasons, or do most people have snow tires? My only concern is living in an apartment with nowhere to store an extra set of wheels. Moved into Oakcliff recently, and I have had a very positive experience thus far. Would definitely recommend Oakcliff to others. Looking forward to living here.

- Matthew from leasing team coordinated my application and helped me view available units/floorplans despite me not being able to visit Ann Arbor for a tour. Very smooth process overall with seeing videos of available units, application, and preparation for move-in.

- Move-in itself was very easy. I really appreciate the private garage which made it easy to unload UHaul. Tons of extra storage space in the garage which is great.

- I had a couple of minor maintenance requests on move-in, and Justin/Amanda were great in helping resolve these. They worked quickly to help me get these fixed and communicated their progress to me via the resident app.

- community amenities are a huge perk. I really appreciate the business center (with free printing!), nice clubhouse spaces, and pool/hot tub.

- close to hospital and lots of food options. Kroger nearby is nice. Overall quieter community than other areas I’ve lived in previously. Ann Arbor Wants to Eliminate Natural Gas as a Heat Source The City of Ann Arbor is seeking a ban on the use of Natural Gas heating in new apartment construction.  In order to win approval for new construction projects, landlords have been offering to not install Natural Gas heating and make their apartments all-electric.  For 2024, the estimated cost of heating with Resistive Heating is 6 times the cost per million Btu's of Natural Gas.  The operating cost of an Air Source Heat Pump is about 2 times the cost per million Btu's of Natural Gas.

Ann Arbor Homelessness Crisis There's been a slew of posts recently about the homeless and aggressive panhandling in town recently, but not much about what can be done about it.

Like seemingly so many other issues we're facing, [homelessness is a housing problem. ](https://groundworknwa.org/news/homelessness-is-a-housing-problem-webinar/#:~:text=Homelessness%20is%20a%20Housing%20Problem%20Introduction,context%2C%20and%20housing%20market%20dynamics)Low vacancy rates, like Ann Arbor's, [significantly contribute to homelessness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137700902638?via%3Dihub) in a metro area.

**Of course, mental health issues play a role, but we're exacerbating the crisis by not building enough.**

Ann Arbor's vacancy rate has been less than 5% for 10 years, per [this](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Berkadia-3Q20-Ann-Arbor.pdf) report from 2020 and [this report from 2025. ](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Berkadia-2025-Forecast-National-Apartment-Research-Report.pdf)Put another way, we've been 95-98% occupied for a decade. Not good.

Luckily, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox, but they start with building more housing to increase the vacancy rate. New market-rate developments pay significantly more in property taxes, money that is needed for many things (schools, water, police, fire, mental health, parks, The Ride, etc.) but for this discussion, funds are now being used to build 63 [affordable units in Kerrytown](https://avalonhousing.org/avalon-ann-arbor-housing-commission-break-ground-on-dunbar-tower/), and soon 330 [right above Blake Transit Center](https://archive.is/g1tQT). These units are set aside for those making 80% of area median income or less.

The more market rate housing that we build, the more money from property taxes we will have to build affordable housing. We did the hard part by passing the Affordable Housing Millage in 2020 and we're now starting to see real progress.

If we ""Pause the Plan,"" we press Play on unaffordability, sprawl, rent surging, and homelessness getting worse.

Crowdsourcing photos/stories of terrible housing situations in Ann Arbor I'm looking to collect photos and stories to share with city council to express just how dire the housing situation is in Ann Arbor. If you or someone you know has a terrible housing situation, please contact me or have them contact me, either by commenting here or by DMing me.

I'm accepting pretty much anything, but some examples of things I'm looking for include:

- Poorly maintained rentals (e.g uninsulated windows, mold, etc.)
- Ridiculous rental ""units"" (for example I looked at a ""studio apartment"" in a house where the bathroom was across a public hallway from the rest of the unit)
- Dilapidated properties (yours or someone else's, but please do not share it publicly - public shaming is the opposite of what I'm trying to do)
- Stories of the city government making housing more difficult (e.g. 3325 Packard - I'll write the story in the comments)

While I know that the situation is terrible for students, I'm mostly looking for non-student examples right now, as I get the feeling that some on city council believe it's *limited* to students. If you send me examples, please also include:

- Whether I'm allowed to make this public (and, if yes, whether you'd like to be anonymous or credited). Non-public stories/pictures will only be shared with city council members and project collaborators.
- The address (won't be shared with anyone beyond telling city council members which ward the address is in - I only want this to help verify that I'm sharing real stories and photos)
- Monthly rent or mortgage
- Any other pertinent details (who the landlord is or if the homeowner owns the home, how this situation happened, etc.)

Housing Situation in Ann Arbor Hi everyone, I might be getting a job offer in the Ann Arbor area within a few weeks and would need to relocate there sometime in the September/October period.

I understand that Ann Arbor is a college town and thus many of the residences/apartments would be already filled. Would getting a suitable \[i.e. not roach infested\] apartment in a reasonably safe locality (no crime etc) be doable in the September/October 2024 period in the Ann Arbor area?

Thanks in advance!

Just go to Japanese Auto on Main (or one of the their referred shops) for maintenance and repair work.

I’ve been using Subaru of Ann Arbor for the last few maintenance intervals on my vehicle because the service manager actually gave me quotes that came in below independent shops for some expensive items. I dropped my vehicle off for about $1,100 worth of work this morning and got a call a few hours later that multiple major safety issues were found during the pre-inspection (leaking head gaskets, leaking cam carrier, both front and rear brakes need to be replaced) and repairs would be over $9,600.

Given that this amount would total my car, I asked them to immediately stop work and just get it put back together and drivable again. To my surprise, claimed they already completed all of the work on a potentially totaled vehicle! I paid my $1,100 bill and picked up my car, but I wasn’t convinced by their assessment. Keep in mind, the vehicle was last brought in 4,500 miles ago and everything looked as good as could be and brakes “half worn on front and a third worn on rear.”

I hadn’t been experiencing any precursor symptoms of the problems they claimed my car had, so I called up Dave over at Japanese Auto on Main to ask for a second opinion. I was able to drop the car off at 1 pm, and he was able to get it fully inspected by 3:30 pm. Thankfully, he confirmed my suspicions that none of these supposed issues were actually present and surmised that it was just a ploy by the dealership to scare me into trading in my vehicle. He believes they went as far as to spread “leaking” oil on the areas they pointed out in the video they sent me to make it look like there were issues. 

I guess I shouldn’t have guessed that I was the “lucky one” when it came to dealing with Subaru of Ann Arbor.

I know this sounds crazy.  It is crazy, but it is real.  My uncle has owned multiple exotic animals in his time (a lion and a bear) and has a permit to own those animals in another state.  A friend of his in this exotic animal world has had a litter of lion cubs and ""owes [my uncle] a favor"" and he wants to GIVE ME A LION.  I don't want a lion. I can't have a lion. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to have one in Kentucky.  He may have already paid for this lion, and he is serious and adamant I need to have this lion cub.  I thought he was joking.  He was not.

I am desperately hoping we can convince him how horrible of an idea it would be if he actually delivers the lion, but just in case, how do I get rid of a lion?!  What would I be facing, legally, if I suddenly were in possession of one?  What would happen to him if he were caught in Kentucky with the lion?

Previous post [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hgr9s6/aita\_for\_walking\_out\_on\_a\_double\_date\_my\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hgr9s6/aita_for_walking_out_on_a_double_date_my_friend/)

At any rate like I said, here goes. It turns out that some of the more pessimistic of you were right, Jane was being obsessive and stalkerish and it sort of all came tumbling down on her at that point. A week or so after I made my post she decided to message me, well it came down to her not understanding why I was showing interest in her and then refused to date her(I never showed interest in her beyond basic friendliness.), A wall of text dedicated to thrashing my previous relationships and calling them all sorts of names, specifically pointing out how I dated the ""Wrong girls"" and a weird rant about how everyone agreed me and her were meant to be, which just isn't the case, like I said in my previous post, there is a running joke in our friend group about how weird she is.

Now, you might think this is something that can be expected, something that just happens, an outlet for her of sorts, except, she send it from the wrong account. See, I had become internet friends with a person In the past month or two, me and her would game together, chat from time to time, you know, the usual organic internet friend situation. And the messages concerning out ""Date"" were sent from this account, turns out she had literally used this alias to infiltrate my ""internet"" friend group and keep tabs on me of sorts? Obviously this freaked me the fuck out, I took screenshots of what she had sent me and afterwards blocked all accounts that I knew now she was using.

I followed that up by sharing everything in our friend discord and in our friend whatsapp group, so everyone could see which resulted in her being kicked from both and I later got a call from Joe full on apologetic, telling me he had no idea and he knew he shouldn't have done it but that his girlfriend was being pressured by Jane, turned out, Jane had literally been bitching at her for months to arrange something like this and she finally caved, again creepy stuff, I told him that I needed some time as he really fucked me over bigtime and I didn't trust him anymore as a result.

While Jane has been shunned by all friends, she still contacted me twice, once to apologize which quickly turned into weird shit where she started talking about ""Us"" she seems convinced there is an us and I am interested and another time just to curse at me, both from random accounts. I am not sure where to go from here and I am still pretty shook up.

**FINAL COMMENTS**

**SnooChipmunks3950**

&gt;I knew it. I told you she turned into a stalker. Using a fake alias. And trying to keep tabs on you. I am not surprised she did this. So Jane was bothering her friend for months. Then she Badger Joe into setting you guys up. So your friend Joe caved in to his girlfriend like she did to Jane. Jane is persistent when she wants something she wants it. And she wants you. And she will stop at nothing to get it. It by getting her best friend to set that double date up with you. It accomplished.. It took months to set up but eventually she got what she wanted. Now as for Joe. He has at least apologize to you. But it's your choice if you believe him or not. Or if you accept it. But at least he acknowledges that he screwed up. But I don't blame you for not trusting him. It will take him a long time for you to gain his trust back. But as long as he is with the girlfriend I would not trust her. Now she calls and apologizes to you. IDK on how to handle that one. But I'll be surprised if she did. This girl lives in a fantasy world. Just be careful and cut all contact. It is she keeps getting the creepy stalker way. Depending on where you live. Tell her you will get a protective order or a restraining order against her. And you would involve the cops. Be safe and watch your back

**OOP**

&gt;&gt;They both apologized like full on longass apology via e-mail, but I am taking my distance for them, low contact, I dont think I want friends that fuck me over like that.

&gt;&gt;As for a restraining order, I think it is pretty damn difficult to get one here.

Pine Valley Apartment Homes,"I was a resident at Pine Valley Apartments from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, they had a pretty nice set of office staff. They hosted an annual ""resident appreciation week"" where they offered free food and raffles for prizes. My roommate and I won a 50in 4K TV, which was great. However, these resident appreciation weeks halted around 2022 for unknown reasons. While living at Pine Valley got off to a great start, it gradually worsened each year. The turnover for office and maintenance staff was incredibly high. I counted about 6 residential managers between 2019 and 2023, all of whom left abruptly. In 2023, they hired a new manager named Kelly. She seemed fine at first, but I quickly changed my mind. I had intended to vacate my apartment but had to cancel this plan at the last second because my plans fell through. Kelly was angry that I cancelled. So she lied, saying the apartment had already been leased to someone else. She attempted to illegally evict my roommate and me from our home, threatening to send lawyers and police to force us out of the apartment. I had never encountered someone so cold before.

Despite Kelly's bosses knowing what she had done, they did not fire her. Kelly continued her behavior, but it was now directed at all residents. Pine Valley had been in non-compliance with the city of Ann Arbor for nearly a year, and Kelly decided to hang signs on the buildings threatening to pass the city fines Pine Valley received onto the residents if they refused to allow city inspectors or maintenance personnel to enter their homes. My apartment, in particular, needed its tub reglazed (something many other apartments also needed). However, my bathtub was chipped and in need of reglazing the day I arrived in my apartment in 2019.

They had ample opportunities to address these problems each time there was resident turnover, for instance, they could have reglazed my tub before I moved in. Therefore, it's preposterous for Pine Valley and Kelly to attempt shifting the blame and consequences of non-compliance onto the residents. Many of the reasons for the non-compliance were due to issues that had been neglected for years. Pine Valley has no one to blame but themselves for their non-compliance. And yes, this means they have to accept the consequences of their greed and neglect. Perhaps they could hang signs on the buildings that say ""We are sorry for neglecting these buildings for many years and not fixing things before you moved in. We want to change that now, so please help us do that."" Rather, this is how they acted in a nutshell: ""Let us fix your homes now that the city inspectors are onto us. If you don't let us in now, we will fine you. How dare you disrespect us."" Hypocrisy at its finest.

I could touch on many other issues, such as how the pool wasn't being cared for anymore as it was filthy most of the time. Conveniently, they would close the pool when the city inspectors came, then reopen it when they left. Or I could mention how the apartment would heat up very easily and it was usually very humid and stuffy inside even with the A/C on or windows open. They did not consider spraying for wasp nests or yellow jacket nests on the buildings or by the pool, so there were a ton of wasps and yellow jackets near the pool or near our balcony. It's common courtesy to monitor wasp/yellow jacket nests to protect residents from being stung. I could never fully enjoy sitting on my balcony with all the wasps flying around. We even had wasps get inside, likely through a crack in our sliding door.

The only positives I can provide are: the rent is somewhat affordable compared to other places in Ann Arbor, the nearby neighborhood is nice, they offer month-to-month leases, and I liked how much closet space we had. However, personally, these positives do not compensate for the major issues I witnessed.

All in all, I do not recommend living at Pine Valley. Unless they learn to treat residents with as much respect as they demand, I don't foresee any improvement at Pine Valley. (UPDATE) My (28F) boyfriend (29M) let my stalker ex (28M) into our apartment to leave me a birthday surprise. How do I handle this absurdity? Hello all, my last post blew up a bit and many people were concerned about me so I'm going to give you this update. I can't even put into words how insane this situation has gotten. Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/lgwJGmWYJ4).

TL;DR my boyfriend Cole has been allowing my stalker ex to send me gifts like it's no big deal, and even let my ex into my apartment to decorate for my birthday.

When I got back home on Friday, I tried to come up with a good plan to keep myself safe while I confronted Cole in case he were to do something scary (a lot of people put the fear of god into me in the comments of my last post). I invited my very tall and intimidating younger brother over to be there while I talked to Cole. My brother couldn't come over until Sunday, so I spent a day and a half awkwardly trying to pretend everything was fine, but I must have done a shit job because Cole kept asking me what was wrong and love bombing me.

Eventually Sunday came around, my brother showed up and I/we grilled Cole about why the hell he's been so fine with my ex coming around with gifts and even letting him in to decorate our apartment for my birthday. I was NOT ready.

All of you had a lot of theories, one of which came up a lot was that the two knew each other and/or were working together to do this. If anything I would have RATHER that been the case because the truth is so much more fucked up.

Basically, Cole has been FIXATED on my ex. He has essentially been stalking my stalker. Cole admitted that he made fake social media accounts (Yes. Multiple.) to follow my ex, and has been stalking his Instagram and Facebook. Apparently, my ex has been making a lot of vent posts about me and how hurt he is that I'm not returning his feelings and have moved on so fast and Cole has b

Planning a round trip around America - 39 states in ~4 months So, I’m planning a massive solo 4 month road trip spanning the country around 2 years out.
The field I work in, I’m around 2 years out from getting a professional license that takes around that amount of time to process, so I figured, hell ill take a few months unpaid leave and go around the country as I’ve always wanted to.

I plan on taking my 4Runner, with a mix of camping, sleeping in the back, and cheap motels every couple days just to reset. I really want to see the nature aspect more in the middle section of the trip with some lesser focus on some of the major regional cities and their local cultures. 

Rough itinerary, but here’s the route I plan on taking. Still very malleable. I plan on leaving end of June and returning some time in late October / early November. Worth noting the lines on the map are not representative of exact routes as of course I will not be taking a submarine from Anchorage to Seattle:

📍New Orleans, LA
📍Pensacola, Tallahassee, then back home in 📌Tampa.

I guess I’m just looking for general guidance from others experience, any cities not worth visiting, any must see stops on the way? I suppose also to see others opinion if this is feasible in 4 months or I should allocate one or two more. I lived at Pine Valley apartments for three years for school. The unit itself is great for its size and price, especially in Ann Arbor. Most of my maintenance requests were addressed right away. Pine Valley was very accommodating during my move and worked out a flexible move out timeline for me which was really helpful. Overall, I was happy to call it home! How is the Indian subcontinent so ethnically, linguistically, culturally and even genetically diverse? Africa’s diversity makes perfect sense, it’s the birthplace of humanity, where people have lived the longest, and where genetic bottlenecks didn’t wipe out variation like they did elsewhere.

But what about the Indian subcontinent? It’s just one region within Asia, yet it’s incredibly diverse ethnically, linguistically, culturally, and even genetically. How did such a comparatively small area end up with so much internal variation?","**Location**

**Management**

ReNew Ann Arbor,"The built in bookshelves are not worth it!!

I never leave reviews, but my experience here was so bad I feel obligated to warn others. The apartment looked cute at first, but it was disgusting when I moved in — hair in the drain, grime in the bathroom, even an old soap bar stuck in the tub.

Management is unresponsive and full of excuses about “system errors.” My microwave broke in December and wasn’t replaced until April. My key card for amenities didn’t work for most of my lease, and when it finally did, the areas were dirty unless tours were happening. The pool didn’t open until late July.

Utilities are overpriced and to top it all off I had to threaten legal action just to get my security deposit back. The aesthetics aren’t worth the constant frustration. Save yourself the headache and live somewhere else. mLive: Sobriety test may be required next time you ride a Spin scooter or e-bike in Ann Arbor Excerpts:

We are very thankful for Renew overall. The customer service with Zac leading the way was fantastic. The location is unreal. I work at the University of Michigan so you just couldn't beat how close we were. We had everything we needed within 10 minutes and somethings were within a minute! We had a baby for the last 2 years and it was a great start to his life living at Renew. Having the garage to park in was clutch and the ice and snow removal on the roads were really good. Just make sure to contact Renew for things you need fixed and they usually did a very good job getting those things done in a timely manner. mLive: Sobriety test may be required next time you ride a Spin scooter or e-bike in Ann Arbor Excerpts:

You will not get what you pay for. I moved in in March. Still here on the one year lease.

I could write a diatribe but I'll keep it concise.

I told them before moving in the reasons I was. I wanted garage parking (I couldn't get a working garage door opener for over a month.)

I told them I wanted to use the Jacuzzi at the apartment gym.

The jacuzzi for the entirety of this year has maybe worked about 10 days. THEY MARKET the hell out of amenities that don't actually work.

When you ask when they will be working you just given an endless list of BS excuses of so called fixes coming up.

Most maintenance requests take forever to get to or are simply ignored.

A bunch of stuff wasn't working in my apartment the day I moved in and took weeks to fix.

If you want to overpay, have amenities they market to pull you in not work, have poor maintenance and hear endless excuses, then this place is for you.

If you don't want endless BS and get what you actually pay for avoid this place at all costs. Ann Arbor Public Schools approves Mideast cease-fire resolution that had stoked controversy ANN ARBOR, Mich. – A public school district in Michigan approved a resolution calling for a bilateral cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war while also encouraging its teachers to discuss the conflict in its classrooms following an emotionally charged meeting Wednesday.

The resolution approved by the Ann Arbor Public Schools board appears to be among the first times that a public school system in the United States has made such a statement on the international conflict.

It followed an over five-hour meeting that stretched into the early hours of Thursday after 120 people gave public comments in both support and opposition of the resolution.

Tensions remained high throughout the meeting in Ann Arbor, a community close to 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Detroit and home to the University of Michigan. Similar tensions have been seen across the nation in response to the war in Gaza, which is now entering its fourth month following a deadly Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants.

The conflict has divided college campuses, where long-simmering tensions are occasionally erupting in violence and shattering the sense of safety that makes colleges hubs of free discourse. Dozens of U.S. cities, including Ann Arbor, have approved cease-fire resolutions that have no legal authority but reflect the pressure on local governments to speak up on the Israel-Hamas war,

The resolution passed in Ann Arbor was one of the first times that a public school system in Michigan had considered such a statement, said Don Wotruba, executive director at Michigan Association of School Boards, prior to the scheduled vote.

“What they’re thinking about doing would be pretty rare, if not the first time. Particularly as it’

I thought that it couldn’t possibly be that bad… I was wrong. Please, please, please don’t choose to live here. It looks nice from the outside. If only they spent as much money on repairing the insides of their units as they did on landscaping. Repeated lies from a dysfunctional - to put it nicely - management team (team as in 1 person, maybe 2, lots of turnover so who knows really). Our apartment has flooded twice within 12 months from the second floor unit’s plumbing mishaps, the AC unit repeatedly broke, the heat would all of a sudden stop kicking on in the winter, they have zero clue who is paying for rental parking spots, they didn’t replace the soiled carpet before we moved in despite the previous tenant having pets (I was told it was replaced), and much more. Hopefully you read this so you can see through their lies on your tour of the property. Despite the way they make it seem, nothing is in order whatsoever at this property. Good luck getting ahold of management by phone (you have to show up at the office in person to get anything addressed in a timely manner). They also don’t know how to work their maintenance request platform in the office - their maintenance crew is the only thing keeping this complex afloat. Maintenance crew is great… just lacking any support from the management side. Ann Arbor Wants to Build Its Own Renewable-Energy Grid | Ann Arbor, Mich., moved forward with an ambitious plan to build its own utility that aims provide clean power outside the grid. I think that this is the first Google review I have ever written and that should tell you all you need to know about ReNew.  Over the course of 8 years of experience in the Navy, living in 7 different states, I have never had an experience with a rental company this unprofessional.  Over the course of a 4 month stretch of Midwest winter, we had to put in around 4-5 maintenance requests for our heat and hot water not working.  I’m a former electrician, so several times I included a full write-up of troubleshooting that I attempted within the reasonable allowance of what a tenant should troubleshoot. Despite this fact, several times the maintenance team showed up (while I was gone), assumed that my girlfriend didn’t know what she was talking about because we had a space heater running, did nothing, and left.

Despite months of inconsistent heat and hot water, ReNew attempted to raise our rent $200/month.  Attempts to contact renew by phone or in person often go nowhere.  For anyone who decides to move in despite this review, here’s an invaluable piece of advice: on at least some of the models of water heater, if you open the pilot window cover, you’ll see a small red rod with wires connected to it.  This is a reset for the internal thermopile, that it seems like none of the maintenance team know about.  If your pilot light goes out and won’t relight, this is probably the culprit.  Press it inward gently, you’ll feel a slight click, and then you should be able to relight your pilot.  As always, never perform work on energized circuits and always follow proper posted procedures and precautions for equipment.

&gt;&gt;As long as they are being peaceful about what their doing anyone can stand for what they believe it it's every Americans freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nazism is an ideology of violence against minorities. They are not being peaceful.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They were just showing their support for the beliefs they have they weren't being violent

&gt;Nazis have no rights.
&gt;&gt;Even they do here it's america EVERY AMERICAN does
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nazisism is a complete rejection of both the social contract and of all american values. Once you show allegiance to nazism, you are no longer an american citizen, and frankly no longer human.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are still Americans and their rights are still protected

&gt;&gt;We should stop allowing hate to be protected.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yea if someone says something you don’t like fist fight them! I’ll vote for you to be the person who decides who should be allowed to yell dumb shit and who can’t.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think if someone is saying something along the lines of white supremacy and direct racism they deserve to be in fist fights. I mean if they're up there preaching how whites are supreme then maybe they should stand on business.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;lol go ahead. In theory that sounds like a blast. Go practice it. Difference in words that hurt your feelings and actions.

&gt;&gt;Believe or not, Nazis aren't the only ones capable of dying. If a gun gets pulled out, plenty of the people with good intentions and innocent bystanders could get hurt. ""Fuck around and find out"" get out of here dude.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yeah, but dead nazis.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This is a ridiculous take — let’s kill civilians, if it means people spouting hateful rhetoric die too?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Remember, this is reddit. Free speech is intolerable to these folks. They truly don’t understand that if one person’s speech isn’t protected, regardless of their message, no one’s is.

&gt;The Constitution was written before the existence of Nazi's.
&gt;&gt;Ok Chuckles and?
&gt;&gt;&gt;I feel if the writers of the Constitution knew that groups like this were a possibility they would agree that if a society extends unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, then the intolerant will eventually exploit that tolerance to destroy the very society that allowed them to exist. In other words, if a society tolerates hate speech, authoritarian movements, and anti-democratic forces, these groups may grow strong enough to suppress the very freedoms that enabled their rise.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I completely disagree and here is why. Freedom of speech and/or expression may be protected by the US Constitution. But it isn't free of consequences. Causing a riot, for any reason, is against the law. While the Nazis who are no doubt members of the KKK enjoy creating the excitement to gain publicity. Don't stand a chance on their own. Unfortunately Police have a duty to protect. But too many more counter protestors to those Nazis and you can bet. Those Nazi bootlickers would be escorted away or left on their own.

So my wife and I will be moving to Ann Arbor from North Carolina this summer for her schooling. Mind you right now we live close to the beach and live in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment for 1600. 

Short question: What in the actual hell is going on with rent prices? 

Am I missing something? Mind you my wife and I are late twenties and early thirties. We dont want to buy just rent. We also would like a nice neighborhood and are looking for a 2b/2b place. Yet the prices for those kinds of places are just crazy! 

They seem to average well above $2k for a decent place. Is this just reality of the area or am I looking in the wrong places. Mind you we would like to be within 30 minutes or so of the north side of the city. I couldn't regret moving here more. Been here less than two months and I can not wait until my lease is up next summer.

My AC has already broken/stopped working twice. First time it took a week for them to fix when it was 80+ degrees outside. Now it's not working again and I'm being told by both maintenance and the office to open a window, since it is too cool outside for it to work. I am paying a lot in rent and air conditioning. Being told to open a window when it is 80 degrees inside my apartment is completely unacceptable. Ivonne, who I was warned about, is particularly terrible, butting in on the conversation and being insistent that it wasn't their fault or responsibility. Exactly what I should've expected out of her. Do your best to avoid dealing with her and this whole complex.

More apartments proposed for development near Ann Arbor’s Briarwood Mall I lived at Ridgewood for 2 years. Lindsay Henson was super helpful to me from the minute I was interested in the place until the minute I left. Very helpful staff. The maintenance team was not great at first, but they quickly hired an incredible maintenance team that was fast and helpful. The amenities here are great for the price. The location is next to every store you could need, and a good spot between both Ann Arbor and ypsi. The pool in the summer was always a nice touch. It was a great pleasure to live here. Ann Arbor Wants to Eliminate Natural Gas as a Heat Source The City of Ann Arbor is seeking a ban on the use of Natural Gas heating in new apartment construction.  In order to win approval for new construction projects, landlords have been offering to not install Natural Gas heating and make their apartments all-electric.  For 2024, the estimated cost of heating with Resistive Heating is 6 times the cost per million Btu's of Natural Gas.  The operating cost of an Air Source Heat Pump is about 2 times the cost per million Btu's of Natural Gas.

Secondly the management has been very responsive to any maintenance problems and all complaints were promptly resolved during my stay.

Like seemingly so many other issues we're facing, [homelessness is a housing problem. ](https://groundworknwa.org/news/homelessness-is-a-housing-problem-webinar/#:~:text=Homelessness%20is%20a%20Housing%20Problem%20Introduction,context%2C%20and%20housing%20market%20dynamics)Low vacancy rates, like Ann Arbor's, [significantly contribute to homelessness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137700902638?via%3Dihub) in a metro area.

**Of course, mental health issues play a role, but we're exacerbating the crisis by not building enough.**

Ann Arbor's vacancy rate has been less than 5% for 10 years, per [this](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Berkadia-3Q20-Ann-Arbor.pdf) report from 2020 and [this report from 2025. ](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Berkadia-2025-Forecast-National-Apartment-Research-Report.pdf)Put another way, we've been 95-98% occupied for a decade. Not good.

Luckily, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox, but they start with building more housing to increase the vacancy rate. New market-rate developments pay significantly more in property taxes, money that is needed for many things (schools, water, police, fire, mental health, parks, The Ride, etc.) but for this discussion, funds are now being used to build 63 [affordable units in Kerrytown](https://avalonhousing.org/avalon-ann-arbor-housing-commission-break-ground-on-dunbar-tower/), and soon 330 [right above Blake Transit Center](https://archive.is/g1tQT). These units are set aside for those making 80% of area median income or less.

The more market rate housing that we build, the more money from property taxes we will have to build affordable housing. We did the hard part by passing the Affordable Housing Millage in 2020 and we're now starting to see real progress.

If we ""Pause the Plan,"" we press Play on unaffordability, sprawl, rent surging, and homelessness getting worse.

TL;DR: support Neighbors for more Neighbors to help reduce homelessness in our great city! There are many things that I love about Shoreview - the location, for one, is wonderful, and the common areas are well maintained. I do not usually mind that there are frequent maintenance issues  (e.g. in winter the heat often has problems due to the age of the pipes) because the maintenance team is typically very responsive, friendly, and helpful  - which I appreciate, thank you!

But I have been having issues getting my dishwasher fixed since December and it is now March...
I have put in multiple maintenance requests about this. After initial attempts to fix the problem did not succeed, I submitted another maintenance request on February 2nd. The maintenance log (incorrectly) lists this problem as being fixed on February 13th. I was out of town at this time and when I returned on Feb 22nd, the dishwasher was still not working properly.  I submitted another maintenance request that day informing Shoreview of this. The maintenance log says that the work was ""completed"" today (March 7th), yet nobody contacted me or came to fix the dishwasher today. I am leaving this review because (1) it seems disingenuous to update the issue as ""completed on  March 7th"" when nothing was done today and the dishwasher is still dysfunctional, and (2) it shouldn't take nearly three months to fix a dishwasher...

ounding area, parking lots, and buildings felt so incredibly safe, I never worried about my packages being stolen, car being broken into or my personal safety.

The best part of Shoreview is that you're treated like a person. With each situation that pops up the staff considers all of the factors and personalized the response and solutions.

I'd absolutely recommend making Shoreview your next home! Ann Arbor landlords charging renters over $6,000 to get in line for apartments Just when you thought renting couldn’t get worse, how about $6,000+ up front just to be in line for a place? After completing my 9 month lease at Shoreview I can confidently recommend living here to anyone. Jenna, at the office, is absolutely fantastic. Very prompt, thorough and kind. The staff is consistently putting together free events for tenants and any maintenance issues are handled swiftly.

I'd absolutely recommend making Shoreview your next home! LL Bean coming to Ann Arbor? I may be breaking some news here. I can’t find anything online about this. They’re updating signage at Briarwood right now and they’ve got LL Bean and Dick’s listed on the sign. There are many things that I love about Shoreview - the location, for one, is wonderful, and the common areas are well maintained. I do not usually mind that there are frequent maintenance issues  (e.g. in winter the heat often has problems due to the age of the pipes) because the maintenance team is typically very responsive, friendly, and helpful  - which I appreciate, thank you!

But I have been having issues getting my dishwasher fixed since December and it is now March...
I have put in multiple maintenance requests about this. After initial attempts to fix the problem did not succeed, I submitted another maintenance request on February 2nd. The maintenance log (incorrectly) lists this problem as being fixed on February 13th. I was out of town at this time and when I returned on Feb 22nd, the dishwasher was still not working properly.

1. The owner's response suggests that the problem related to not using the dishwasher correctly, which was not the case. After posting my review, the broken dishwasher was acknowledged and I was told that a replacement would be ordered.
2. Two weeks later, the moldy and rusty replacement has been installed (see additional attached photos). Waitlist set to open for new affordable apartments for artists, homeless in Ann Arbor We lived at this residence for 2 years and had a good experience overall. We had quite a few small maintenance issues over our time at Shoreview, but Justin and the gang were always quick to respond to our requests. Our biggest complaint is the laundry setup...the machines are small, expensive, and are constantly out of order; unfortunately they are outsourced to a separate company so they are not the maintenance team's issue.

Very happy we spent our time in Ann Arbor here, right next to the Huron River, utilizing the pool, adequate parking, and basement storage unit provided. 5-story, all-electric apartment building approved on Ann Arbor’s north side I've been living here for 3 years and the leasing office (Jenna & Kristen) always provide exception and friendly service. The maintenance team does similarly exceptional work and I'm always happy to great them and have pleasant chats around the property. EV TW: [Cadillac Celestiq], Ann Arbor, MI. $340,000 starting price. Anyone know how many of these exist rn? Maintenance has always been very timely after I put in a request. They recently came to do a preventive maintenance inspection in preparation for the winter and the maintenance guy was very mindful about taking his shoes off after entering and cleaning up any messes made during repairs. I really appreciated it! Anyone lived in a below-street-level unit at Hidden Valley Club (Ann Arbor) or any apartment? Hey everyone,

I recently checked out an apartment at **Hidden Valley Club (building 605)** in Ann Arbor and wanted to get some opinions. The unit I saw is on the **ground floor**, but I’m not sure if it technically counts as a **basement apartment** — it’s one level below street level, and the apartment floor level is about 3 feet below the street outside.

I’ve never lived in a place like that before, so it felt a bit strange to me. I saw mixed reviews online about Hidden Valley Apartments, so I’m wondering if anyone here has **personal experience living there**, or **in a similar below-street-level apartment**.

Also, are these kinds of apartments usually **less preferred** or something people generally **avoid**? Curious to know what others think before I make a decision.

Would really appreciate any insights.

South Grove Apartments,"Moved in to South Grove Apts about two and a half months ago and thought it was time to provide a Google review.

First off, when I was looking for a place, the associates were glad to show me available units, no surprise. Nick was glad to take me through the units TWICE, spent as much time as I wanted and provided the unit layouts with measurements for walls and windows to help me out with planning. Service plus. When we got back to the office, the other associated seemed surprised at how long we out. I guess it wasn't typical for a double visit to units, but Nick hooked me up and was all patience and informative.

When I moved in Nick and Dia were extremely helpful in getting me set up with the company web site, how to use it, set up visa and bank accounts, and also utility monthly info and how the payments worked. I don't use it, but SG implemented a policy for residents that they can pay throughout the month using a flexible rent payment routine. Another indication that residents come first here.

I'd had some issues with Ann Arbor apt living in past years owing to seemingly lax maintenance operations. Not here at SG. Lindsey Stallsmith, the SG Manager is always attentive to work orders with me. The response is almost always same day, and she takes care on follow-up. She always has a smile and a good word when I am in the office, really friendly and helpful. It says something when I know the folks in the office team. It's a good relationship and they are always there to help no problem. Like I said, residents are a priority, especially after move-in! As for the maintenance guys, Gregory and Charles have helped me a lot and are capable and informative about any issues. When they see me out in the complex, they always have a good word and an update on whatever work is going on. Lindsey is also taking care of making sure residents know about general work projects going on in the complex, like pavement work for example. The little parties they throw at the pool or the office and Halloween for the kids are a good place to get snacks and see the other residents.

I've read other reviews about the SG appliances being rather old, but they seem to be on a remod kick, and on turnover in apartments they are updating appliances and counter tops, etc. Had an issue with a stove top burner and Charles hooked me up right away. You aren't left without at SG.

I'm enjoying the apartment living here not least because it's quiet and friendly. I mean really quiet, mellow. When I do see other residents they are pretty friendly too. The large sliding glass door in the living room is eight foot across and it gives me a nice view out onto the common area, full of trees and grass and I can watch folks walking their dogs and chilling out. I really like the view and the bright light it lets in. I've got a storage closet for extra stuff located in the building and I keep the bike there along with some other stuff. Handy. Always a park spot close to the building front door. No problem getting deliveries. Even the mailman is friendly.

Adam from Maintenance is in right now working on the kitchen counter caulking. Another good job for me.

Great place overall, thanks to Lindsey, Dia, Nick, Adam, Charles and Gregory for the making apartment living here comfortable  and easy for me. Best

Mat (3583-6) I have a plan: Lake Inferior safety violations are ignored until fines become more expensive than the fix.

The apartments do not meet the minimum building code for insulation and you heating and cooling bill will be insane.

Their maintenance staff is so understaffed that a broken bathroom sink takes approximate a month to fix, but they wont hire more or use contractor when they are overwhelmed.

Repairs and improvements are not planned, these are slumlords. Live somewhere else.

Edit: I've spoken to your office enough to last me a lifetime. You've heard about every one of these complaints several times and the only time you ever took action is when I rbiught city insectors. Every single time your budget was the reason you gave me. Fire extinguishers, falling branches, Doors that have 2"" if ice buildup inside the apartment, fixing none of that was in the budget.

If you find any broken links, misspellings, or inaccurate information, please let me know. Thanks. I had such a great experience with this apartment complex from the very start. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful throughout the entire process. My tour was informative and gave me a really good feel for the community. What stood out the most was how responsive everyone was, whether I had questions over the phone, through email, or in person, they always took the time to help me out. Moving into a new place can be stressful, but they made it feel easy and exciting. Highly recommend! Geography Trivia: Both the Ann Arbor Meijer and Ypsilanti Meijer are in Pittsfield Township Pittsfield Township is weird. There's parts that feel like Ann Arbor (Ann Arbor-Saline Road, Ellsworth, and the Airport), Ypsilanti (Carpenter Rd north of I94), Ypsilanti Township (Carpenter Rd south of I94), and Saline (Textile Rd). Very little of it actually feels like ""township"". safety violations are ignored until fines become more expensive than the fix.

Spice Tree Apartments,"My move-in process was so smooth and well organized! I am truly grateful for my leasing agent Kerstin and her support during the whole process. I was looking for a quick move-in before the start of the semester and Kerstin made it possible! If you are looking for a well organized and truly caring management team I highly recommend Spice Tree Apartments. Crowdsourcing photos/stories of terrible housing situations in Ann Arbor I'm looking to collect photos and stories to share with city council to express just how dire the housing situation is in Ann Arbor. If you or someone you know has a terrible housing situation, please contact me or have them contact me, either by commenting here or by DMing me.

I'm accepting pretty much anything, but some examples of things I'm looking for include:

- Poorly maintained rentals (e.g uninsulated windows, mold, etc.)
- Ridiculous rental ""units"" (for example I looked at a ""studio apartment"" in a house where the bathroom was across a public hallway from the rest of the unit)
- Dilapidated properties (yours or someone else's, but please do not share it publicly - public shaming is the opposite of what I'm trying to do)
- Stories of the city government making housing more difficult (e.g. 3325 Packard - I'll write the story in the comments)

While I know that the situation is terrible for students, I'm mostly looking for non-student examples right now, as I get the feeling that some on city council believe it's *limited* to students. If you send me examples, please also include:

- Whether I'm allowed to make this public (and, if yes, whether you'd like to be anonymous or credited). Non-public stories/pictures will only be shared with city council members and project collaborators.
- The address (won't be shared with anyone beyond telling city council members which ward the address is in - I only want this to help verify that I'm sharing real stories and photos)
- Monthly rent or mortgage
- Any other pertinent details (who the landlord is or if the homeowner owns the home, how this situation happened, etc.)

If you're not comfortable sharing publicly, please DM me for an email address where you can share. I appreciate maintenance taking the time to remove the mold and debris from the bottom of the dishwasher; however, the filth was still present throughout the machine, in cracks, holes, and along the seals.  I purchased three different dishwasher cleaners to try and finish removing the black mold and gunk, but nothing has worked.  More and more black gunk comes out of the vent in the door and the sprayers.  The dishwasher is unsanitary and unsafe for use, so we hand-wash all dishes.

The dishwasher should have been examined and thoroughly cleaned between tenants.  I raised concerns about the state of the apartment when I moved in.  The apartment does not meet my living standards.  The dishwasher should be replaced.  The air conditioner should be repaired or replaced.  The bathroom fan should be replaced.  The rubber seal on the fridge should be replaced.  The fridge door handle is also cracked.  The cupboard under the sink should be sanitized and repaired.  The paint peeling in the shower is not an appropriate material for bathrooms and has to be cleaned out of the drain every week.  When we moved in the apartment was filthy.  A drawer in the kitchen was stuck open about 5 inches because the previous tenants had jammed Tupperware in it.  I had to clean food off the walls and floors.  There were wrappers and screws on the floor and the bedroom door could not be used because the hinges weren’t attached/it was hung incorrectly.  The flooring was cracked and sunken in.  The shower head was cracked and sprayed on the ceiling and over the shower curtain.  You cannot control the temperature of the shower.  The fan in the bathroom does not work properly.  Water runs down the walls and drips from the ceiling.  Either the apartment was not inspected, or the company is fine with the apartment being in such poor condition.  My electricity bill is $500/month because the air conditioner runs all day but the temperature of the apartment just keeps going up during the day.  It doesn’t function properly.  We couldn’t stay in the unit the first two nights because it was 80 degrees inside.  We left two messages for maintenance that weekend.  They never called back.  After a couple of weeks I called the managers office to complain and they opened a maintenance ticket and had someone come out, but they only fixed 1/4 of the issues and said they would talk to their supervisor about the rest.  That was a month ago.

Edit: 9/16 - I am editing this to add that the apartment complex replied to this review stating they addressed the issues and appreciate the opportunity to make things right.  This is a lie.  No one spoke to me or has been in my apartment since they said they would talk to their supervisor.  They left me a voicemail.  I called back after hours and left a voicemail.  No one ever called back.

Also, for the last month there has been food or vomit splattered up the stairs and ground into the carpet.  The cleaners have come to vacuum at least twice, but nothing has been done to actually clean the carpet.  This place is disgusting.

&gt;&gt;*Tom and Jim had bought a place together, but when Tom proposed his than fiancée wanted Jim out. It all blew up a couple weeks before their wedding. While Jim was in a hotel looking for a new place my Husband offered our place for him to crash. He had already received money for his share of the property to invest in a new one. So Jim lived with us for about 3 months until he moved out to his own place.*

# **Final Update - 11 days later**

[**Update: I don’t want to go on the family trip my ex-BFF invited me on after he ghosted me.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mih41w/update_i_dont_want_to_go_on_the_family_trip_my/) 

I didn’t think I’d be updating this quickly, but here we are.

I took your comments into consideration, along with what’s been coming up in grief counseling, and made some peace with parts of the situation. I don’t hold Tom accountable for not supporting me: you can’t demand support from someone who never really offered it. And Tom and I had already grown distant before my husband passed, but I can’t pretend it didn’t hurt. Tom went to the funeral, but after that: nothing, not even a text.

To answer what a few asked: No, I’m not romantically involved with Jim. We’ve gotten close this past year. My son adores him. But I’m not ready to open my heart again, and Jim’s never hinted at wanting more. Our therapist calls our relationship a “limbo”. Not quite something, but too close to be nothing. Especially now, with my son asking Jim to go to his Father's Day presentation because “he does dad things and now he doesn’t have a dad.”

So yeah…it’s weird. Confusing as hell, with a small kid in the mix.

Now for the update: I decided to call everyone individually (my parents, godparents, each of Tom’s siblings, including Jim). They were all understanding. They suggested a small trip for my birthday without Tom, which I agreed to. They’re right, I do need some normalcy, but that doesn’t mean pretending nothing happened.

I left Tom for last. I was honest with him. He got frustrated that I wasn’t willing to “just let it go.” He said he hates hospitals, he was scared for his brother and froze, after some time he just didn't know how to make amends and asked me to not make him the villan. I kept thinking that while he ""froze"" I had news that Jim might never wake up by a doctor, and less than an hour I was making calls to let my in-laws know that their son was gone. 

I took care of the funeral because I could not ask my MIL to do it, she was doing her best with my son at home while also grieving the loss of her son, my parents and godparents took the first flight avaliable, but still it was only on the next day. I let Tom know that it is unfair of him to compare his fears to what I had to endure alone those first 48 hours.

He understood we’re never going back to what we were. He still organized the original trip with his siblings, but he knows I won’t be there. I’m not ready to talk to him again beyond this. Hopefully, my birthday trip will be a good start to moving forward, and that Tom will respect the space I need without pushing.

&amp;nbsp;

**TOP/RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**u/Odd-Consideration754**
&gt;What confuses me (and maybe I missed it somehow) is why is Tom’s wife suddenly ok with op going on a trip with tom? It seems like she would be even more insecure now that she is a widow and technically single (even though I fully understand you wouldn’t be interested no matter what)
&gt;
&gt;Was tom not going to tell her about the trip and let her lose her mind on a grieving woman when she found out?! Or did she know and have intentions of being hurtful to her on the trip?
&gt;
&gt;**OOP**
&gt;&gt;*I truly have no idea if Ann was ok or not about me going on a trip. We don’t talk since their wedding. I never really tried to make any amends with her. After cutting Tom too I realized that sometimes a rift is a good thing.*

---

**u/the_greek_italian**
&gt;If he wants to ""just let it go,"" then he can start by making a proper apology. The very LEAST he could have done was send you a text. He cannot let his own fears and wife's boundaries be an excuse for his behavior when the rest of his family was still able to reach out and be there for you. Not to mention that you helped take care of his brother!
&gt;
&gt;I'm quite curious to know where his wife stands with this trip he planned knowing you had been invited.
&gt;
&gt;**OOP**
&gt;&gt;*Being honest I really don’t know if Ann was ok or not. We don’t talk since their wedding. I remember remarks from while I was in the wedding party. Her friends were always saying it was “weird that he lived with his brother and were still close to his childhood friends”. We come from different backgrounds. Our family is Italian, our grandparents were Italian, we don’t get merry and to leave the family but to make it grow. 
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;My husband was also from a Italian household so for him it made as much sense as it did to me, he was very close to all his cousins and even after his death I am still close with his family, just yesterday I was in his cousin’s daughter Baptism not out of politeness, but because I’m still family. Ann’s family is different you get married and only special holidays or events are “family” but nuclear always come first. I don’t know if this makes sense to you guys.*

Spruce Knob Apartments,"I moved into an apartment that already had two plumbing issues and was given the wrong mailbox key. It took them two months to have everything in order after multiple reminders. Some sort of issue with the plumbing would arise at least once every couple of months; sometimes management is fast but sometimes slow.

Be prepared to pay about $50/mo extra for water, sewage, trash, etc. in addition to electricity and gas with DTE—they take the building’s total and divide it by the number of residents and bill each individually.  They did not tell me this when I asked on the phone about utilities before renting.

Management makes up rules and fees with short notice, for example, a penalty for not filling out their special notice to vacate form by 60 days before the end of the lease—which you’re not given or told about until 3:13pm 60 days before the lease ends—even though you’ve notified them in writing months before that you will not be renewing, and requested information on any other protocols or procedures to be aware of. Fortunately I was on top of everything and never got dinged but still, this is another reason for not recommending Spruce Knob.

Overall, the apartments look nice at first but once move-in day arrives, you realize how poorly managed they are when they tell you day-of that you can’t pick up your keys until 4pm. I thought this was one of the better McKinleys, but I guess not. Some aspects of the apartments are good—the appliances work well and they have good sound and temperature insulation, the former being particularly important as the community is right next to I-94. So I very generously rate this place 2/5 stars. But seriously, my advice is just don’t bother. There are much better places in Ypsilanti that are way more affordable.

&gt;&gt;As long as they are being peaceful about what their doing anyone can stand for what they believe it it's every Americans freedom
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nazism is an ideology of violence against minorities. They are not being peaceful.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They were just showing their support for the beliefs they have they weren't being violent

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nazisism is a complete rejection of both the social contract and of all american values. Once you show allegiance to nazism, you are no longer an american citizen, and frankly no longer human.

Nice apartment complexes? I'm very excited to be moving to Ann Arbor :) I'm 31 and it's just me.

I'm currently renting a (very) small house built in the 30s in a quiet wooded area in Southeastern US: it's been fun, but the bathroom, kitchen and appliances leave much to be desired.

As a result, I wouldn't mind paying more to live with some nice amenities, especially with my pay raise! 

Looking for 1/2bedroom. My dream is a complex that offers a sauna (I'm part Finnish). I'd love suggestions?

(I'm not a big redditor so if this is the wrong place to post, let me know and I'm sorry-- please don't yell at me!) We had a wonderful experience with Sarah during our move-in!

Ann Arbor Homelessness Crisis There's been a slew of posts recently about the homeless and aggressive panhandling in town recently, but not much about what can be done about it.

Like seemingly so many other issues we're facing, [homelessness is a housing problem. ](https://groundworknwa.org/news/homelessness-is-a-housing-problem-webinar/#:~:text=Homelessness%20is%20a%20Housing%20Problem%20Introduction,context%2C%20and%20housing%20market%20dynamics)Low vacancy rates, like Ann Arbor's, [significantly contribute to homelessness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137700902638?via%3Dihub) in a metro area.

**Of course, mental health issues play a role, but we're exacerbating the crisis by not building enough.**

Ann Arbor's vacancy rate has been less than 5% for 10 years, per [this](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Berkadia-3Q20-Ann-Arbor.pdf) report from 2020 and [this report from 2025. ](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Berkadia-2025-Forecast-National-Apartment-Research-Report.pdf)Put another way, we've been 95-98% occupied for a decade. Not good.

Luckily, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox, but they start with building more housing to increase the vacancy rate. New market-rate developments pay significantly more in property taxes, money that is needed for many things (schools, water, police, fire, mental health, parks, The Ride, etc.) but for this discussion, funds are now being used to build 63 [affordable units in Kerrytown](https://avalonhousing.org/avalon-ann-arbor-housing-commission-break-ground-on-dunbar-tower/), and soon 330 [right above Blake Transit Center](https://archive.is/g1tQT). These units are set aside for those making 80% of area median income or less.

The more market rate housing that we build, the more money from property taxes we will have to build affordable housing. We did the hard part by passing the Affordable Housing Millage in 2020 and we're now starting to see real progress.

If we ""Pause the Plan,"" we press Play on unaffordability, sprawl, rent surging, and homelessness getting worse.

TL;DR: support Neighbors for more Neighbors to help reduce homelessness in our great city! My experiences living here has been amazing. The maintenance team is very professional and very fast. Manager Korey is also very nice to talk to. I think this is one of the best and most affortable plus safe place to live in Ann Arbor. Highlt reccomended. Missing cat at Spruce Knob? There was a cat meowing outside the door of my apartment at Spruce Knob. I'm not sure how it got into the building and it's too late at night to go knocking on neighbor's doors. So, if anyone knows of someone missing a cat around the south side if Ann Arbor or at Spruce Knob it may be in my apartment building. Until recently, my experience living at Spruce Knob has been mostly positive. I have been a resident for 3 years. Repairs to the air conditioners for my unit and three others have been ongoing now for 2 weeks, and my AC is still not functional. Last weekend, it was very hot and we were not notified repairs wouldn't be completed on the timeline that was initially shared. Thankfully, the outside temperatures have been cooler this week. The communication from McKinley during the repair process has been very disappointing. I and the other residents impacted have mostly relied on one another for updates when we've been able to connect with the contractors directly. I decided to post this review in hopes it leads to positive change and better experiences for other Spruce Knob residents moving forward.

Update: Communication improved at the end of the repairs, and I received daily updates via text from Korey.  The contractor came back on Saturday morning at the end of the second week to resolve the final issue, which was much appreciated. Everything has been working well for the past week.

State Street Village Apartments,"So far this has been an A+++++ experience. Communication has been spot on. After our last experience this has been a huge relief. Thanks so much to you ALL and especially Javairia. She has been amazing and helpful. Also thanks to Emily for phone call and communication!! When communism in Poland collapsed, the state owned farms were often abolished and the workers were left with nothing but a commieblock apartment in the village middle of nowhere and no farmland of their own. No surprise these places are plagued with dysfunctions like suicide and unemployment. So far it looks pretty safe and everything they promised online is what you get. However, it is ridiculous that the rooms do not have personal door locks unless you install yours. The lighting in the apartment is another matter, gives the apartment a dull look in my opinion.
Another problem is the leasing office, my previous apartment has a leasing office where at least one physical person is there to help and when packages arrive, you are sure it is safe during the open hours. Here is another matter entirely, the leasing office is almost always closed and when you do call, there is almost never someone to answer or help, which is frustrating. This also makes package delivery tricky as vendors deliver my package to different locations around the apartment and I have to do a hide and seek for my own package, because delivery location is tricky and the leasing office does not handle it. I am quite disappointed.
I however complained to the manager and the lighting in my room was changed and upgraded. The leasing office hours have been extended and more accessible, although the delivery location of packages now varies. And the neighbor with their dogs (a floor above) will frustrate the saint out of you as the walls are thin-proofed and you can hear everything. The location is very secure and quiet but the rent is a bit on the quite expensive side. And it gets increased every renewal year (a fact I have to get used to).

 just assumed the receptionist who had called her had misread the results or confused her with someone else.

So, that was that. This was a horribly stressful and confusing week for the both of us, made only worse for me by the reddit post. I showed it to her shortly after we got the results and she said it would have stressed her out too.

I'm not sure if post updates are allowed on this sub, or if this is the correct way to update a post, I don't really care. This experiences sort of just reinforced my hatred for redditors. Hope you guys enjoyed the unnecessarily long update to the drama. One stars because there’s damage to the unit prior to our lease causing our utility bill to be $800 a month regardless of speaking with maintenance it was said that it’d be fixed wasn’t ”fixed”. Debris and garbage all around the property. Old maintenance man actually grabbed my shoulder which is battery but suddenly the camera footage of the office disappeared.
Also my wife was broken in on while showering by the same maintenance man, doors locked knocked briefly and then proceeded to use his key to enter as my wife walked down the stairs in a towel.
Excuse from management was the notice to inspect auto offs (things above stove below microwaves) must have blown off the door. Traffic jam at the railroad crossing on Liberty and 1st Street, Ann Arbor Michigan, 1941. So far this has been an A+++++ experience. Communication has been spot on.

What are the most unforgettable food you’ve tried while traveling? Hey everyone!

\-- UPDATE --

WOOW !! I didn't expect that kind of response, so much advice and food, amazing!

Let's use it to do something awesome. 

Please keep adding your favourite food, and give me a few days, and I will build a map including all of your recommendations, so all of us can benefit from it on the next trip!

Try to be specific about the location so it will be easier to put on an interactive map.

\--------------

I’ll start first. Please share your favourite food memories from your travels, too! 😋

Whenever I visit a new place, I’m always curious about the local cuisine.

Before I go, I usually research some recommended spots, but honestly, the best food is often hidden. I check some forums, YouTube vlogs, or ask local people.

Here are some of my most memorable food experiences from my trips.  
P.S. Sorry if I missed some details, I tried my best to provide an accurate location and description :)

Img 1) Philippines, North Palawan - Socorro Hills View  
Lomi soup - a thick, savory noodle soup, with Egg, pork, topped with chicharon (crispy pork skin)

Img 2) Philippines, Manila - Jim’s Pares &amp; Mami  
Beef Pares with Rice and Bone - a beloved Manila comfort meal of tender, sweet-savory braised beef with rich bone marrow, paired with rice and a warm beef broth. Very local experience and taste.

Img 3) Philippines, El Nido  
Mixed seafood platter - For me, always a good idea when you’re this close to the sea!

Img 4) Singapore - Hill Street Tai Hwa  
Pork Noodle (Street food with Michelin Star) Guo Liao Tang - a noodle soup with several kinds of meat and delicious liver, flavorful and totally worth trying.

Img 5) Singapore - Haig Road Putu Piring  
One of the simplest yet most unique desserts I’ve ever had. Made from rice, coconut, and brown sugar. Prepared by a family who’s been perfecting the recipe for generations.

Img 6) Singapore - one of the food hawker  
Dry noodle ramen, very tastyImg

Img 7) Singapore - one of the street restaurants  
Hot Pot with Frog - Very popular local dish

Img 8 &amp; 9) Cambodia, Siem Reap - HAVEN  
Khmer Amor - A must-try traditional coconut curry with fish (or chicken). We also had a tasting menu with a few appetisers, can’t remember what exactly, but it was all delicious.

Img 10) Thailand, Bangkok - Ann Tha Din Daeng  
Creamy Tom Yum Goong - A lovely local spot packed with Thai people. I’d had Tom Yum before in Europe, but this version was on a whole new level - rich, spicy, with loads of chilli and lemongrass. Locals usually share one soup and two rice portions; we ordered two soups and one rice… mistake! It was so spicy we needed a ton of drinks 😂 But it was amazing!

Img 11) Thailand, Bangkok  
Mango sticky rise - Perfect for breakfast, such a simple dish, yet so hard to find in Europe with the same authentic flavor.

Img 12) Thailand, Bangkok - Don Mueang Airport  
Some crab in a different form, pretty good, like for the airport, very good value. Unfortunately, I don't have a photo, but the food at Singapore airport is another level. They had a food hall with street food with amazing quality and the same price as in the city.

Img 13 &amp; 14). Vietnam, Ha Giang - random village.  
Pho soup - Best I ever ate. The family made their own noodles and cooked everything on a traditional wood-fire stove. No English, no menu, just pure taste and tradition.

Img 15)Vietnam, Ha Giang, North  
Okay, I know it was just Chinese soup noodles from the market and the cheapest frankfurter, but with this view, I don't remember much about taste. Overall, it was a good food experience.

Img 16) Vietnam, Sapa  
Hot pot with black chicken - Traditional Sapa dish. The black chicken has less meat and a chewier texture than regular chicken. Unique and flavorful, but not for everyone, I definitely discovered a new taste.

Img 17) Vietnam, Sapa  
Sturgeon fish - Another local speciality. It is a quite rare fish that you find fresh in a few places around the world.Very delicious and fresh, they basically catch it in a basement tank when you order it.

Img 18) Vietnam, Hanoi  
Vietnamese spring rolls - I made myself in a cooking class, somehow the best I've tried (probably great teacher), but to be honest, it is the best way to discover local cuisine - do it with local people.","**Location**

 generations, and square pizza with a caramelized crust has been a staple of the Detroit diet for decades.

People go on coffee tours, wine tasting tours, and donut tours. Heck, there’s a video of a guy driving around making himself sick to figure out which fast food chain has the best chicken sandwich. Detroit would have amazing pizza tours.

To demonstrate, I’ve written up a hypothetical itinerary that you can find [here](https://freshcoastthoughts.com/?p=238).

Would throngs of people go on a full day tour of pizza? Probably not—at least I hope not for their sake. My point, however, is that there’s more than enough here to attract visitors to our distinct food scene, even if we keep it limited to just pizza.

## Beyond Eating the Pizza

On a bourbon tour in Kentucky or a wine tour in Napa Valley or even a cider mill visit here in Michigan (our best kept secret that I’ll cover in a future post), you don’t just ingest the product—you discover what goes into making it. That’s the piece that’s missing from Detroit’s pizza experience.

Imagine a place in Eastern Market where you could learn how to make your own Detroit-style pizza. Maybe it offers classes where you can learn from the pros, or you could rent space in a kitchen and pull from a library of ingredients to perfect your own recipe. Maybe it has a store attached where you can buy the pans to make your pizza at home.

Moreover, Detroit could host annual events, such as pizza making competitions, a pizza tasting event, or simple industry conferences. These events would draw in visitors from the region and—because we’re the pizza capital—might even rise into something bigger.

Finally, like I’ve mentioned in previous posts, Detroit’s existing attractions could incorporate pizza exhibits to pique visitors’ interest in our institutions and give them more to do. As an example, the Detroit Historical Museum could have a “History of the Detroit-Style Pizza” room, or the Michigan Science Center could have a “Science of Cooking” interactive exhibit with a special emphasis on pizza.

## The Unquantifiable Benefits of Detroit-Style Pizza

We’re used to seeing economic effects in the data. The pizza industry, for example, creates countable white-collar jobs at corporate offices and spawns recession-proof supportive businesses (e.g., advertising agencies and pizza pan manufacturers). Since the industry is concentrated here, it has a large job multiplier, creating numerous positions for people with different skillsets.

There’s something to be said of the unquantifiable effects, as well.

If someone who hears “Detroit” and thinks of pizza instead of crime or blight or dying industries, that’s a win. In fact, if they just hear “Detroit” more often, the city won’t seem so scary—it may no longer seem far-fetched to take that job offer or open a new store or take the family for a weekend trip.

It can be difficult to discern why we are drawn to places. Maybe it was the KFC commercials for their Nashville Hot chicken that made me think of stopping by Nashville while driving home from visiting family. Maybe it’s those delicious Hawaiian rolls that make me want to—okay, that one’s a stretch, but you get my point. Detroit-style pizza is free advertising for the city, not just the food. It encourages people to come here for a taste of the original, or to at least make a detour on a road trip.

On the local level, city pride may make people want to stay here. Personally, our pizza—along with Better Made chips, Coney Islands, Mediterranean, and cider mills—make me never want to leave Detroit. It’s different for everyone, but by and large, people love pizza. People deserve to know we have the best.

The rooftop lounge is great for studying during the day and having friends come hang out at night.  Downstairs, the official study lounge has been a lifesaver for getting homework done, especially in bad weather when walking to the library isn't ideal.  The study lounge is also great because it has a printer, resident computers, AND a coffee machine with Starbucks coffee.  (It's amazing to just be able to walk downstairs and get a free coffee in the morning, let me tell you that.) However, my favorite part about living here is my apartment.  Coming from the dorms, I have loved having a washer and dryer inside my apartment with me (no more trudging up and down flights of stairs with a heavy laundry basket!).  The kitchen is also phenomenal.  I love to cook and bake, and the counter space and dual-compartment sink makes prepping and cleanup easy.  The floors in the kitchen, living room, and bathrooms are a breeze to clean as well.  The apartments come fully furnished (even with a TV that lets you easily connect your Netflix account!) and the wifi is reliable and speedy.  Even though the rooms in my particular unit are relatively small, the beds are lifted high enough to make it easy to store items underneath and a little bit of organization really makes the most of the space! Everyone, from the maintenance crew to the office staff, is very kind and helpful here.  They also organize fun events and hand out food on special occasions!   I would recommend living here to anyone who's considering it. Ohio's yearly weather summed up in one shot....","**Location**

Surrey Park,"Cute small park near condos and more housing.  But a nice walking/running trail that is like 1 mile around.  A duck pond and beautiful trees! The winningest sports cities in the US and Canada (some original research) What is the best city in the US and Canada to live in to be a sports fan? I've added up the number of seasons professional teams from the top six sports (the big four, plus Canadian football and outdoor soccer) have played in each city, and the number of times a team from that city has won their league's championship.

The average percentage is 6.28%. A season is what it sounds like. If a team split its games between two cities or moved mid-season, I gave 0.5 seasons to each city.

##Footnotes

1. Some teams named for Cleveland (mostly the Cavaliers) actually play(ed) in Richfield, which is in the Akron metro area. No championships there though, so this only dragged Akron's percentage down and boosted Cleveland.

2. The final champion of the USFL, the Baltimore Stars, actually played their home games in College Park, which is in the Washington metro area. Sorry Baltimorians.

3. For 62 seasons, the Green Bay Packers played up to 3 games a year in Milwaukee, so I've split those years between the two cities. If you don't, Green Bay is 13/92 (14.13%) and Milwaukee is 2/115 (1.74%).

4. Teams who played in LA County are 27/284 (9.51%) while those in Orange County are 2/88 (2.27%).

5. Splitting it up by boroughs and suburbs, it looks like this: The Bronx is 28/122.5 (22.86%). Brooklyn is 4/111 (3.60%). Manhattan is 18/316 (5.70%). Queens is 3/72 (4.17%). Staten Island is 0/4 (0.00%). The New Jersey suburbs are 11/163 (6.75%). The Long Island suburbs are 7/51 (13.73%).

6. For the Bay Area (San Francisco and San Jose metro areas), it's split like this: The East Bay is 9/141 (

Call | WhatsApp: +256755470380 Had an amazing tour with Destini H! She was extremely helpful, personable, and very knowledgeable about the property. I appreciated how smooth she made the entire process! Hypothetical Ann Arbor Tram Network I think returning trams/streetcars/LRT to Ann Arbor would be awesome but I am also biased because they're my favorite way to get around cities. A project like this would need to be a partnership between the university and city which, on its own, is almost disqualifying provided how slow they are to collaborate (mostly UMs fault unfortunately).

 I tried my best to connect the areas with the highest population density and current+planned urban cores (retail and core mixed-use zones is what the city calls them). Like any network, it would start small and grow with demand, though I'm not sure which of these lines would make the most sense as the pilot line.

I wanted to add another line to the SE side of town and to expand the network north of the river, but I wasn't sure just where they should go. Let me know what you think! I lived at Surrey Park for 2 years and had a great experience all around.  The staff, specifically Jason, the property manager, and the maintenance guys, always went above and beyond to address any issues that came up or questions I had.  The location is great and the community is very safe and quiet.  I loved having laundry in unit and a huge attic, plus a little patio to myself, and I always had peace of mind knowing the management and maintenance team had my back.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a more affordable, quieter complex compared to most places in Ann Arbor.

The Courtyards Student Apartments,"I coming onto a year and a half of staying in the courtyards and I can say that its been a pleasant experience for the most part.

Units are fully furnished, having my own bed and bath is amazing, walls are thin so sound easily passes through, you get your own washer and dryer and a fully done up kitchen so amazing overall

Location wise its the best you'll get (on north campus) - NCRB next to you, Bursley in front if you want a meal plan, football pitch on the side for outdoor runners and tons of food spots behind as well as bus stops for both Bursley baits (S side) in front and the ride for Ann Arbor in the back (N side)

I do believe that though stated in the lease there are often times extra fees that one wouldn't expect such as the recurring annual community fee or annual electricity startup fee though I have already been living here or the high cost of key replacement and they aren't necessarily willing to work with you/are extremely strict with their rules even for special circumstances. Outside that they host cool events (Ive honestly not been to many but its great to know they do) and even have a game room which I like to go hang out in with friends to play billiards or watch a game on the huge tv.

Utilities(elec+water) are also a little high but not unmanageable at about 40-50USD per person per month for a 3bed3bath apt

Outside that the support team (via the app) for any issues regarding the apartment such as leaks, damage etc are absolutely on point and very friendly as well as timely.

In summation. If asked whether I'd like to live here again given the choice - yes I would Non Student Moving to Ann Arbor Hi! My partner just got into grad school at UMich so we’re planning to move to Ann Arbor in August. Since I am not attending UMich and won’t know anyone already in Ann Arbor, is it fairly accessible to meet people not only associated with the university? I’m nervous about being able to find community without having the university to depend on since I won’t be a student and don’t have many connections with UMich. 

When I went to college in a college town, it seemed difficult for people not involved in the campus to integrate in the town. The Courtyards is definitely a nice apartment building if you like convenience for a higher price. All apartments are fully furnished (my favorite is the in-house washer/dryer, no more paying for washing my clothes!!) and the maintenance on the building/apartments is extremely well done. When there’s a problem it usually took maybe 1 day at most for someone to come look at the apartment. And the staff are very receptive to questions/emails (I locked myself out at very odd times and they helped me out a lot) . I would totally recommend. Movie shot entirely in Ann Arbor with several recent U-M grads in the cast and crew premieres downtown Thursday! My team and I shot a feature film in Ann Arbor this past summer and it's premiering at the Michigan Theater this Thursday! 

The bulk of the cast and crew are either current students or recent grads from U-M, WSU, and MSU. 

We'd love to see you there!

It is impossible to reach them -- their AI phone service routinely hangs up on you.  I have notified the City of Ann Arbor building inspector because I have not gotten answers. Small but practical apartment shared with gf in Ann Arbor, Michigan Great apartment! I lived here for several months and felt really welcomed.

The place is super convenient for North Campus, clean, and has everything you need… nice study areas, gym, and hangout spots. Cal is a really good guy, super easy to talk to, and actually makes things run smoothly. You can tell he cares about helping residents out. Overall, solid place to live and great experience so far. Anyone lived in a below-street-level unit at Hidden Valley Club (Ann Arbor) or any apartment? Hey everyone,

I recently checked out an apartment at **Hidden Valley Club (building 605)** in Ann Arbor and wanted to get some opinions. The unit I saw is on the **ground floor**, but I’m not sure if it technically counts as a **basement apartment** — it’s one level below street level, and the apartment floor level is about 3 feet below the street outside.

I’ve never lived in a place like that before, so it felt a bit strange to me. I saw mixed reviews online about Hidden Valley Apartments, so I’m wondering if anyone here has **personal experience living there**, or **in a similar below-street-level apartment**.

Also, are these kinds of apartments usually **less preferred** or something people generally **avoid**? Curious to know what others think before I make a decision.

Would really appreciate any insights. 

Thanks! The Courtyards is definitely a nice apartment building if you like convenience for a higher price. All apartments are fully furnished (my favorite is the in-house washer/dryer, no more paying for washing my clothes!!) and the maintenance on the building/apartments is extremely well done. When there’s a problem it usually took maybe 1 day at most for someone to come look at the apartment. And the staff are very receptive to questions/emails (I locked myself out at very odd times and they helped me out a lot) . I would totally recommend. Small but practical apartment shared with gf

The Ann Arbor Building Boom Walking around downtown makes you realize Ann Arbor is in the midst of a building boom. 

There are certainly cons in addition to the pros, but I think it is a net positive in terms of density and vibrancy, jobs, taxes, and retail and entertainment options. 

If I could add a wishlist: 

1. More housing for the middle class. 
2. More plants of all kinds, but especially trees. I love that summer feeling of green foliage spilling onto the sidewalk.  
3. Better public transit. How about autonmous shuttles circling around downtown?
4. I honestly believe all multi-family units should be required to have balconies. It activates the public realm, puts “eyes on the street,” and I think all humans should have a little slice of the outdoors. I coming onto a year and a half of staying in the courtyards and I can say that its been a pleasant experience for the most part.

Units are fully furnished, having my own bed and bath is amazing, walls are thin so sound easily passes through, you get your own washer and dryer and a fully done up kitchen so amazing overall

Location wise its the best you'll get (on north campus) - NCRB next to you, Bursley in front if you want a meal plan, football pitch on the side for outdoor runners and tons of food spots behind as well as bus stops for both Bursley baits (S side) in front and the ride for Ann Arbor in the back (N side)

I do believe that though stated in the lease there are often times extra fees that one wouldn't expect such as the recurring annual community fee or annual electricity startup fee though I have already been living here or the high cost of key replacement and they aren't necessarily willing to work with you/are extremely strict with their rules even for special circumstances. Outside that they host cool events (Ive honestly not been to many but its great to know they do) and even have a game room which I like to go hang out in with friends to play billiards or watch a game on the huge tv.

Utilities(elec+water) are also a little high but not unmanageable at about 40-50USD per person per month for a 3bed3bath apt

Outside that the support team (via the app) for any issues regarding the apartment such as leaks, damage etc are absolutely on point and very friendly as well as timely.

The Emerson Apartments,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
If you’re hunting for a place to call home, stop scrolling and call Terrye at The Emerson—she is an absolute ROCKSTAR! 🤘

From the very first message, Terrye brought the perfect mix of knowledge, energy, and genuine excitement. When we changed our minds halfway through one floor plan, she didn’t miss a beat—she had a backup ready and guided us straight to the perfect layout we fell in love with. That kind of adaptability is rare, and she made it look effortless.

What really sets Terrye apart is how deeply she knows the area, the property, and the kind of community that thrives here. She’s not just showing apartments—she’s matching people with homes.

Through the entire process—touring, applications, paperwork—she was bubbly, friendly, and laser-focused on making sure we had everything we needed.

And here’s the best part: if she didn’t know an answer, she found it. Fast. No runaround, no fluff—just results. That’s the kind of professionalism you don’t see every day.

We came looking for a place to live, but from the moment we pulled into the drive, Terrye had us sold. She’s the real deal, and The Emerson is lucky to have her. Ann Arbor Apartments or condos with pond and/or great scenery     What are some Ann Arbor apartments or condos to rent that have great scenery and outdoor grass/ponds/room? My three year old loves being outdoors and I am looking for something comparable to what we have now. I am at Cambridge club apartments in Scio township, and the pond that you can walk around is excellent (aside from goose poop). 
I currently have a tour scheduled for Surrey Park, although I have heard the old fashioned heating unit can hike up rent in the $400 range (which I could not do). 
 I am looking to stay in Ann Arbor for safety reasons, but would be open to Ypsilanti suggestions as long as in a safe area. His daycare is Annies children’s center in Scio twp and the closer the better. 

Other things needed to help responses :
- Ideally under $1800 for 2 bedroom ( I know that’s hard) 
- cat friendly 
- in unit washer and dryer 

Thank you 😊 I have worked with Hannah in the past finding an apartment to live and she is so easy to talk to, really listens to her clients wants and needs and is super reliable and communicative throughout the whole process! She is knowledgeable about the property and the area and is a joy to be around and work with! Definitely recommend requesting her to assist you in your apartment finding journey! She is the total package and will walk you through the journey and assure you end up in the perfect spot for you!!! ISO venue for Christmas Eve for a group of 20 near ann arbor.

I don’t feel safe as a young woman walking the streets by myself anymore. I have lived here my whole life.  The people that are hanging out on the streets everyday, or that are homeless are becoming more and more aggressive. It doesn’t matter if you’re being a good person to these people or not their intentions are not good. I didn’t have any money to spare and I got called a stupid bitch as the person came after me because I didn’t have any money to share. The worst always happens to in the city when I walk alone. I have had old men come up to me and threaten to rip my bag off my shoulder because I didn’t have $2. Just for the record I am not an expensive looking person I dress and thrift store, clothing, and shop at Plato’s closet. 

 I am saying this out loud for any people that are walking the streets without the knowledge that things are changing very quickly in Ann Arbor. Don’t pull your money out and show people what you have if you do decide to help, and always travel with a buddy. I don’t know how to advocate for Ann Arbor becoming respectable again, or ways that we can help some of these people if they even want it. It’s incredibly unfortunate and sad to see happening in the city of Ann Arbor. I know there’s a lot more behind it, and my main point to this message is people be safe and always be aware of your surroundings even more then usual when you’re in this area. Updated: Originally thought this was a great place but after they got my application they ghosted me. to an extent I understand because I had a dispute (not even for late rent or anything). I let the rep TK know this was being taken to district court by me AND disputed as they had no grounds. I heard nothing back it's been  a week. Very unprofessional. I decided to go with another apartment but the least they could've done was let me know it was a no as I paid over $100 for the application and did my due diligence with a cosigner.

Absolutely beautiful place. I was thoroughly impressed it checked all the boxes to me. I was shown around by Terrye Kraft  who was incredibly kind and helpful. I told her mid tour ""I'

I'm considering moving to Ann Arbor Woods Apartments and was wondering if anyone here has lived there. How’s your experience been?   
Any pros or cons you can share would be super helpful. Thanks in advance! We recently toured this community and were absolutely blown away by the welcoming, red-carpet feel of the lobby. Every detail—from the spotless glass doors to the fresh-baked pastries waiting for residents and guests—has been thoughtfully curated, and it all comes without a premium price tag. Terrye, our leasing professional, was the epitome of hospitality: knowledgeable, responsive, and genuinely invested in helping us find our perfect home.

Beyond the stylish common areas, the neighborhood is wonderfully quiet yet just steps from shops, cafés, and groceries. As pet owners, we couldn’t be happier with the well-maintained dog areas and additional pet amenities. If you’re looking for a blend of comfort, convenience, and a touch of luxury without breaking the bank, this place checks every box. We can’t wait to move in!

Thank you 😊 I’ve had such a great experience at Emerson Apartments. The community is clean, modern, and well-maintained, but what really sets this place apart is the staff. Terrye Kraft is absolutely amazing—she goes above and beyond to make residents feel welcome and cared for. From the very first interaction, Terrye was professional, friendly, and genuinely helpful. She is quick to answer questions, attentive to details, and always makes sure any concerns are handled promptly.

It’s rare to find someone who truly makes apartment living feel stress-free, but Terrye does exactly that. Her kindness and dedication make this not just a place to live, but a place to feel at home.

I can’t recommend Emerson Apartments—and especially Terrye—highly enough!! Ann Arbor Homelessness Crisis There's been a slew of posts recently about the homeless and aggressive panhandling in town recently, but not much about what can be done about it.

Like seemingly so many other issues we're facing, [homelessness is a housing problem. ](https://groundworknwa.org/news/homelessness-is-a-housing-problem-webinar/#:~:text=Homelessness%20is%20a%20Housing%20Problem%20Introduction,context%2C%20and%20housing%20market%20dynamics)Low vacancy rates, like Ann Arbor's, [significantly contribute to homelessness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137700902638?via%3Dihub) in a metro area.

**Of course, mental health issues play a role, but we're exacerbating the crisis by not building enough.**

Ann Arbor's vacancy rate has been less than 5% for 10 years, per [this](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Berkadia-3Q20-Ann-Arbor.pdf) report from 2020 and [this report from 2025. ](https://berkadia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Berkadia-2025-Forecast-National-Apartment-Research-Report.pdf)Put another way, we've been 95-98% occupied for a decade. Not good.

Luckily, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox, but they start with building more housing to increase the vacancy rate. New market-rate developments pay significantly more in property taxes, money that is needed for many things (schools, water, police, fire, mental health, parks, The Ride, etc.) but for this discussion, funds are now being used to build 63 [affordable units in Kerrytown](https://avalonhousing.org/avalon-ann-arbor-housing-commission-break-ground-on-dunbar-tower/), and soon 330 [right above Blake Transit Center](https://archive.is/g1tQT). These units are set aside for those making 80% of area median income or less.

The more market rate housing that we build, the more money from property taxes we will have to build affordable housing. We did the hard part by passing the Affordable Housing Millage in 2020 and we're now starting to see real progress.

If we ""Pause the Plan,"" we press Play on unaffordability, sprawl, rent surging, and homelessness getting worse.

The George Ann Arbor,"We lived in this place for two years, and our experience with management was very disappointing. They required a 60-day notice to move out, which is unusually strict compared to other places I’ve rented. Even though we told them well in advance that we were leaving, we responded in writing through the electronic form they sent asking if we wanted to renew or not, clearly indicating we did not want to renew. Despite this, they didn’t send us the official notice form until there were fewer than 60 days remaining. Once we received that form, we promptly filled it out and returned it.

Despite this, they claimed we had given insufficient notice and charged us for an entire extra month of rent, even though our lease only ran 7 days into that month. On top of that, they withheld our entire security deposit without any clear explanation beyond saying it was used to cover the extra month, even though we were already charged separately for it.

We emailed them and called multiple times on different days from different phones trying to resolve the issue, but they were very slow to respond and ultimately offered no solution. We ended up having to pay everything they demanded.

Also be aware that they have a policy where you are only allowed to pay rent on the first day of the month, and if you forget, they charge you $100 per day for each day it’s late. I feel this is extremely strict and unreasonable—they don’t give you any grace period or payment window. I’ve never encountered anything like that in other places I’ve rented.

In every other apartment I’ve lived in, simply confirming the lease-end date was enough notice, and I always received my full deposit back. This has been my worst rental experience. Help with school list Weird applicant: I am 20 years old but starting my second gap year.

To cast your vote simply include the name of the team you think will win enclosed by {} as part of your TOP LEVEL comment (i.e. a post reply as opposed to a reply to an existing comment).  For example {Michigan}.  **You need not create a specific comment just to vote.**  Simply include your vote in line during your post discussing the match-up or include it at the end of your comment.  If another poster manages to change your mind with their detailed points and emphatic discussion simply edit your original comment accordingly. You can change your vote as often as you like until the GAME THREAD is posted.  Each user only get's a single vote per match-up, so if you make multiple {Vote} comments the system will record whichever it reads last; if you cast multiple {Votes} in the same comment the system will only consider the first {Vote}.

A full listing of accepted FBS team aliases can be found [here.](http://cfb.diydunce.org/teamlist.php). For FCS teams you will need to use the full name as it appears in the post title.

/u/Rivalrybot will be along shortly to make a comment with the results as well as update the results every couple of minutes and will comment in the eventual game thread with the final results.

Recent concerning events at Ann Arbor City Council Meetings make the August 4th election even more critical **The election on August 4 super important** because way too many people don't realize the city council is determined then, not in November. These elections have the most direct control over some of the issues that matter most when it comes to the important work of dismantling structural racism, with control of **housing** and the **police** going to the very top.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, in Ann Arbor there is a faction in the city council that actively votes to deny new housing projects in order to preserve the ability of a handful of homeowners and landlords to continue amassing wealth without doing any work. This has the side effect of exporting poverty and gentrification and contributes to Washtenaw County being the 8th most segregated county in the US.

**[Here is a video of Council Member Kathy Griswold giving me a ""thumbs down"" in the middle of my public comment about the role of housing policy in continuing segregation.](https://www.facebook.com/AnnArborForEveryone/videos/823838701354390)**

This group, Council Members Jane Lumm, Anne Bannister, Jack Eaton, Kathy Griswold, Jeff Hayner, Elizabeth Nelson, and Ali Ramlawi, are backed by Stephen Ranzini, the CEO of University Bank who routinely brags about the tens of millions of dollars of mortgages his bank underwrites monthly (they only seem to do well when Republicans are in the White House controlling the regulators though). [Ranzini, who went to Yale in the 80s and was given a $45 million bank as a gift from his dad at 23, also claimed he suffered worse racism than most Brown and Black people because he is half Italian](https://www.facebook.com/joe.spaulding/posts/10160157375177228).

The Haven of Ann Arbor,"I was initially very interested in leasing a unit at The Haven of Ann Arbor—the property itself looked great and seemed like it could be a good fit. Unfortunately, my experience with the management team was extremely disappointing. Trying to get in touch with the property manager to ask even basic questions was incredibly frustrating. Communication was slow, inconsistent, and unprofessional, which left me with serious concerns about how issues might be handled if I became a tenant. Ultimately, I decided not to move forward with the lease solely because of the poor management experience. I hope the team improves their responsiveness and professionalism for future prospective residents. [REQ] ($200)-(#Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (repay $110 on 12/5 and $110 on 12/12) (cashapp, Apple Pay) My 4 year old son has a really bad case of RSV, so I haven’t been working because I’ve been with him in the hospital. My landlord sent an eviction notice because I was 50 dollars short on rent, and they added another 100 dollar late fee and 50 dollar filing fee, that I just don’t have at the moment, but I don’t have another way of getting it before we go to court! If anyone could help I would really really appreciate it! Thank you. I have been a resident at The Haven for more than a decade.  The management maintains the property well.  The maintenance crew is prompt, polite, and effective.  The rent is fair.  Most important, the management office is courteous, kind, and helpful.  My cat got lost on the grounds recently, and Kelly, a leasing agent, circulated emails and coordinated action with a couple of the other tenants to find my cat and return him safely to me.  Kelly's help went above and beyond the call of duty.  Her  generous kindness represents the spirit of the management staff at The Haven.

The interactions with him have always been a pleasure. He made things so much easier for us. Too Good to Go is in Ann Arbor! Not sure if y’all have heard of the Too Good to Go app but it is a great way to try new places in the city for major discounts. Restaurants and grocery stores will post surprise bags full of food that would otherwise go to waste at heavy discounts, and you can reserve one and pick it up within a time range. I have used the app in other cities and really loved it and I’ve been waiting for almost a year for it to hit Michigan  and it finally has. I haven’t tried any Ann Arbor locations yet but yesterday I was able to try some of the Detroit places! I got a bag from Detroit Institute of Bagels (8 bagels and 1 huge loaf of bread for $5!) and Yum Village (a carryout container stuffed with jerk chicken and fried plantains for $5!!) today and they were both excellent. Wanted to spread the word to help generate interest in the app, it’s a fun one, and the more successful it is the more restaurants and stores will want to sign up! 

If you get the app I recommend going to the “Browse” tab and using the map view to select your range, the “Discover” tab is a little more cluttered. :) We really appreciate our time at Haven - it is such a beautiful and peaceful place for family to live.

Took my girlfriend up to new buffalo, south haven and saugatuck for 3 days, in October for her birthday. It was a nice short trip. Loved it. Thinking of going back to Michigan in the last week of December. We are driving, we live in suburb outside Chicago.  We are in our early 40s.  Which cities is best to visit this time of year? We are looking to stay in Michigan for 4-5 days.  Thanks. I've been a resident of the Haven for 3 years now. I cannot in good conscience recommend this estate to anyone who has a modicum of self respect.

For one, the management here have their priorities completely skewed. My previous upstairs neighbors would stomp on the floor and blast music at 4am at least once a week and management refused to contact them despite it in clear violation of the lease agreement. Only after they had terminated their lease, they sent an empty threat to a completely empty apartment. Even after they quite literally flooded my apartment at midnight, management refused to resolve the issue. I had to call maintenance to enter my neighbor's apartment and fix their flooded toilet.

I had been in contact with management for over 6 months about my noise complaints and my water damaged
...
 No one should be subject to such petty inconveniences for the premium price that they charge.

I have consulted a lawyer about this matter and will be taking further action against them for violating their portion of the lease agreement. If being subject to any of this pointless conflict and legal disagreement excites you, then by all means, join the haven. Predatory behavior of recent Ann Arbor mayoral candidate, Dylan Manna, who has affiliation with U-M Physics department Some of you may have come across the name Dylan Manna in recent weeks, as he ran a late campaign for mayor of Ann Arbor (as a write-in candidate). When news of his campaign broke, a post was made on the Ann Arbor subreddit (link below) that sparked a series of concerning comments regarding Dylan’s predatory behavior and grooming of teenage girls and young women in the Ann Arbor area and U-M community, that has spanned several years. Many of the women who commented shared similar experiences of sexual harassment and assault. I, too, share this experience. I am afraid to go into details here, because, as others have shared - I fear for my safety.

I wanted to bring this post to the attention of this community though, because I know some of you (particularly young women) may have been targeted by Dylan too, as I had been as a student. If you have, and you can relate to this post: I am so sorry you have experienced this too. And for those of you who haven’t encountered Dylan, please take this as a word of caution. He is active in the downtown area and on campus. He occasionally leaves Ann Arbor to spend time in New York, but given the mayoral campaign, he is back in town. He may tell you he is pursuing a PhD in Physics (which he has claimed for many, many years). The Physics department does not list him as an active PhD student or graduate, though he does seem to have some ongoing affiliation with the department as a visiting scholar. He has also had a tutoring side business over the years. Needless to say, he has easy access to the young women he targets. Please, please beware.

The Highlands Apartments,"The Highlands are an awesome place to live. I've been living here since fall semester and I have enjoyed every minute. The maintenance workers and Dana are really friendly and helpful. Its pretty cool living next to the woods because not only is it a quiet environment but you'll see some cute little deer here and there. However I would not suggest living on the ground floor if you are afraid of little critters. I have literally seen every type of bug you can imagine in my apartment. There have been moths, camel crickets, and giant house spiders galore. Ann Arbor, Michigan: The unlikely Metro Detroit city and college town that has rapidly become a magnet for Gen Z, as 36% of its 133,000 residents are apart of the age group. The city also holds Americas largest Football Stadium. Dozens of apartment buildings are in the works as the city contributes to Detroits increasing housing prices, which are the fastest rising in the country. Had a wonderful experience living here for the past two years. The staff was incredibly warm and kind, especially the building manager Kristine, and never had any issue that wasn’t fixed in less than a day. The location is not only conveniently close to North Campus and a few shops and Kroger, but Central was less than a twenty minute bus ride via the Bursley stop five minutes away.

Can’t recommend it enough. Ann Arbor is falling apart. I don’t feel safe as a young woman walking the streets by myself anymore. I have lived here my whole life.  The people that are hanging out on the streets everyday, or that are homeless are becoming more and more aggressive. It doesn’t matter if you’re being a good person to these people or not their intentions are not good. I didn’t have any money to spare and I got called a stupid bitch as the person came after me because I didn’t have any money to share. The worst always happens to in the city when I walk alone. I have had old men come up to me and threaten to rip my bag off my shoulder because I didn’t have $2. Just for the record I am not an expensive looking person I dress and thrift store, clothing, and shop at Plato’s closet. 

 I am saying this out loud for any people that are walking the streets without the knowledge that things are changing very quickly in Ann Arbor. Don’t pull your money out and show people what you have if you do decide to help, and always travel with a buddy. I don’t know how to advocate for Ann Arbor becoming respectable again, or ways that we can help some of these people if they even want it. It’s incredibly unfortunate and sad to see happening in the city of Ann Arbor. I know there’s a lot more behind it, and my main point to this message is people be safe and always be aware of your surroundings even more then usual when you’re in this area.

The staff was incredibly warm and kind, especially the building manager Kristine, and never had any issue that wasn’t fixed in less than a day.

Mind you right now we live close to the beach and live in a 2 bed 2 bath apartment for 1600. 

Short question: What in the actual hell is going on with rent prices? 

Am I missing something? Mind you my wife and I are late twenties and early thirties. We dont want to buy just rent. We also would like a nice neighborhood and are looking for a 2b/2b place. Yet the prices for those kinds of places are just crazy! 

They seem to average well above $2k for a decent place. Is this just reality of the area or am I looking in the wrong places. Mind you we would like to be within 30 minutes or so of the north side of the city. Had a wonderful experience living here for the past two years.

""Last year in September I was bit in the face by a pit bull while I was outside with my chihuahua.  I am left with scars on my face and a blind spot in my right eye.  I had to receive rabies shots as well due to the dog not being vaccinated.

Over the last six months I’ve been trying to find a way to sue the owners and the apartment complex.  Because the owners don’t have insurance and because the apartment rules were nothing signed off on (they are more like guidelines) every lawyer has denied me since we have no insurance recovery from this happening.  
  
I am now suing the owner directly without insurance and my understanding from what I’ve learned the last six months is that this is now the only way I can have my medical bill possibly paid.  I will sue and try to get what I can, but recovering the full amount is not likely.  
  
This is my only option left after suffering permanent damage to my face.  I really would like to put this horrible incident behind me once and for all.  Thank you for your time and support.  It means a lot.""

The Ivanhoe Apartments,"Hardwood floors, very spacious, and great pool. Quiet community and respectful neighbors. Free parking, close to downtown, pet friendly and great coffee shops within walking distance (York and Roos Roast). Ann Arbor is falling apart. I don’t feel safe as a young woman walking the streets by myself anymore. I have lived here my whole life.  The people that are hanging out on the streets everyday, or that are homeless are becoming more and more aggressive. It doesn’t matter if you’re being a good person to these people or not their intentions are not good. I didn’t have any money to spare and I got called a stupid bitch as the person came after me because I didn’t have any money to share. The worst always happens to in the city when I walk alone. I have had old men come up to me and threaten to rip my bag off my shoulder because I didn’t have $2. Just for the record I am not an expensive looking person I dress and thrift store, clothing, and shop at Plato’s closet. 

 I am saying this out loud for any people that are walking the streets without the knowledge that things are changing very quickly in Ann Arbor. Don’t pull your money out and show people what you have if you do decide to help, and always travel with a buddy. I don’t know how to advocate for Ann Arbor becoming respectable again, or ways that we can help some of these people if they even want it. It’s incredibly unfortunate and sad to see happening in the city of Ann Arbor. I know there’s a lot more behind it, and my main point to this message is people be safe and always be aware of your surroundings even more then usual when you’re in this area. Convenient location and the layout of the apartments is nice. Shifts in management have made communication inconsistent, pool pump was broken most of last summer and couldn't get access this year because everyone thought it was someone else's business. I wonder if there are structural issues that cause it to keep being acquired by different management companies? Nice neighbors. deciding between two ann arbor apartments i was wondering if anyone lives in Emerson Apartments or ReNew and could tell me the pros and cons. i am deciding between those two as they are the best i have seen in my price range, but looking at the reviews make me a little worried Pamela and Ellise were very professional and accommodating.  I called and asked if possible to schedule a tour that day. They were able to do it.  The apartments we saw were refurbished.  They looked very nice and clean. They took the time to answer our questions. We had a very positive experience. Living cost in Ann Arbor and finding apartments I was recently accepted to the dental school, and i've been looking into apartments. The estimated living costs are \~40k/year. Is this actually true? My living cost at my undergrad in a different state is no more than 20k (granted, the town is quite affordable anyways) but I did not expect A2 to be so expensive. 

I could find a nice apartment with all the amenities I want for just over 1k at my uni, but Ann Arbor seems to have decent apartments at double that price. I don't want to spend more than $1500 on rent, is this possible if I live in a 2bed/2bath? If I want a 1bed with central ac and in unit laundry, how much should I expect to spend? Scheduled an appointment for a tour and was stood up.  No guidance on where to find leasing office, which was not obvious at all and required asking tenants.  Even tried to reschedule and they never responded.

Quiet community and respectful neighbors. Free parking, close to downtown, pet friendly and great coffee shops within walking distance (York and Roos Roast). Making my first feature film, Ann Arbor, that centers the Asian American experience in the Midwest Hi, I'm Trevor Zhou, an LA-based writer/director and I'm pushing to make my first feature film, [Ann Arbor](https://www.annarbormovie.com) that's a bittersweet love letter to my home town that we're pushing to shoot in October.

It's a narrative film that's inspired by my experience as a Chinese American immigrant 35 years into my immigration. It's about what this person gave up of their own culture to assimilate and also what they tried to keep. The vibe is kinda like Before Sunset meets Past lives and explores the what-ifs in life, the nuances of privilege and the expectations we’re burdened with.

We just brought on a producer that recently had the #1 trending movie on Netflix called [Mending the Line](https://www.netflix.com/browse?jbv=81768966) with Brian Cox (Succession) and one of our executive producers is Anna Wong, niece of the first Asian American film star, Anna May Wong. I'd love to share the concept of the film with the community as I've seen so many posts about how many don't feel represented by the films and TV shows out there.

The film is about an Asian American man who returns to his hometown, Ann Arbor, after twenty years and reconnects with his former best friend who never left. Over the course of a single night, a nostalgic walk turns complicated as they reconcile their attraction to each other, their cultural differences and how the years apart have changed them.

This is the film that I wish was around when I was a young adult that shares a representation of a thoughtful, vulnerable and honest version of Asian American masculinity that one doesn't often see in cinema.

This is a completely indie film and immensely authentic to the story that I know. So many of the details in the film and pulled directly from my own story and is a labor of love.

I'm a graduate student looking for a cheaper place to live once my current lease is up in the summer. I'm looking for a dog friendly building that is a fairly easy commute to central campus. My max price for rent is $1600 a month. Everything in Ann arbor I've seen so far, including where I am now, is pretty expensive, so I'm also looking in Ypsi. A lot of places also appear to have mixed ratings. For example, I toured spice tree apartments and was interested, but it has some pretty mixed reviews online and I'm kinda a loss about to think. Do people have apartment recommendations or experiences (positive and negative) that they'd be willing to share? Thanks!! Convenient location and the layout of the apartments is nice.

Apartment review: Ann Arbor Woods, Pine Valley, and South Grove apartments I’m moving to Ann Arbor in the summer to start grad school at UM. I’m moving by myself and am trying to find housing. These apartments are all in my price range and have very mixed reviews. Ann Arbor Woods seems like the best but there are several reviews about an unresolved rodent issue. I do see positive reviews for all the locations but did see a bad review saying the office offered them money to leave a good review - I don’t know if that’s common practice but it’s left me uneasy. 

Has anyone actually lived in one of these places or know someone who has? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!! Set up an appointment to see a unit, and they stood me up!

My friend moved here recently, and they say they had issues with the wrong keys given before move in! These employees have serious issues in the upstairs department. Now management and maintenance are ignoring them about maintenance items, as well as items getting destroyed in basement after rains, as well as cracks in walls in basement letting water in and windows leaking water in basement.
This management company is terrible! They are literally trying to compete and beat McKinley for worst landlord in Ann Arbor.

The Legacy at Ann Arbor,"Living at Legacy Apartment Complex in Ann Arbor has been an absolutely awesome experience! Everything about this place is top-notch, and I love calling it home. The staff is super friendly and made the whole move-in process super easy. The apartments are gorgeous!! The amenities like the gym and pool are fantastic, and the community events add such a fun, welcoming touch. I’m so happy here and couldn’t ask for a better place to live! Dr. Domenico Grasso named interim president of the University of Michigan I’ve been living here for a few months and it’s a decent apartment. The amenities are nice and I especially like the study room and club room. The outdoor patios are well kept and let me get some sunlight. I'm interested to see how it will be kept during the winter season. I’m a big fan of the gym as well. There's a lot of equipment and I'm able to complete my usual workout.
For the apartment itself, there are some details that you can tell were a bit rushed. There are some dents in the walls and paint splatters on the floors. Nothing that is serious or takes away from it being a decent apartment. I had a hole about the size of an eraser on a pencil in my shower floor. I put in a work order and it went through fast. They patched it up and all is good now.
The elevators are constantly breaking down. I haven't heard of anyone being trapped in it, but I will go to use them and one or two are shut down for repairs.
All in all, it's a decent apartment. With it's location and amenities, the price for rent makes sense. Rural white kid snag Ivy from poor public school **edit: I know I made a typo in the title :(**

**Letters of Recommendation**

English teacher (9/10) - I read it and thought it was pretty good, but considering my results and the rest of my application , it's fair to assume that this carried a lot of weight - had them for two years, close relationship, helped advise my #1 extracurricular

History teacher - I haven't read it and therefore won't rate it, but I only got this recommendation because I thought I needed a subject-area teacher letter for Georgetown (which I didn't end up needing, anyway). Sent it everywhere I could send additional letters, though, and I guess it ended up working

Vice principal - I haven't read it and therefore won't rate it, but we were very close and they are the reason my #1 extracurricular was as successful as it was. Also worth noting they are a Georgetown alum and wrote a separate letter of recommendation for them, but you'll see how that went at the end (there was also a general letter of recommendation for every other school, too)

**Interviews**

Georgetown - I thought it was fine, but I guess they thought otherwise lol. Only interview I had

Brown - not an interview, but my video was literally just me playing guitar (and I pretty lazily tied it back to social change through my interest in Bob Dylan lol)

**Essays**

I'm going to be honest, I thought my essays were just okay, but comparing my results to my application implies that they did some heavy lifting - a lot of my ECs/awards just don't have the impact a lot of other people's do. So, my personality must have come across quite well in my essays. My personal statement was about an anecdote that represented by desire to ""find my voice"" for the sake of pursuing social change, and the rest of my essays reflected that narrative. I will say that I was self-deprecating sometimes in my writing, but I think it came off as self-aware and worked well

8. And 9 Police Research indicates that police may treat female aggressors more leniently than males, leading to lower arrest and citation rates for women, Conversely, evidence suggests that both male and female officers may be more likely to use physical force in situations with a male suspect compared to a female one even if the aggression from the male arrestee is not showing aggression. Additionally, gender-based biases can affect police investigation and response to crimes like domestic violence and sexual assault.

Lower arrest and citation rates: Studies have shown that female offenders are arrested and cited less frequently than male offenders for similar offenses.  
Bias in response to domestic violence: A number of research indicates that male victims of domestic violence report that police fail to respond or take their report seriously, sometimes leading to the male victim being arrested instead of the female aggressor.

9. ""Men commit more crime"" This is based on data that states, ""Men commit more crime based on the fact they make up 80.6% of arrests."" Except if you do further research you will find ""Yes, crime data and their subsequent calculations and analyses are widely recognized by experts, researchers, and government bodies as being susceptible to significant biases and limitations. This is due to a variety of factors, including underreporting (men under reporting) of crimes, police discretion (typically against men) , and systemic inequalities (black men and mexican men) in the justice system."" Also, Crime data is based on both reported crimes and arrests, but it is crucial to understand the difference: reported crime data reflects crimes that are reported to law enforcement, while arrest data reflects the number of arrests made by police. These two sets of data do not tell the same story because many crimes go unreported and not all reported crimes result in an arrest. (All in which information provider earlier is biased against men, which causes a very biased calculation of data; that being the reason for ""men commit more crimes""

[](https://www.reddit.com/user/Similar-Pear4585/)



10. Research indicates that teachers tend to be harsher on boys regarding discipline but may exhibit a grading bias that favors girls, even for similar academic performance. This suggests that bias exists, but its manifestation differs depending on the context (behavior vs. grades).  
Disciplinary Bias  
Boys receive harsher punishment for the same behavior problems as girls including assault. Studies have found that early childhood behavioral issues have a more significant negative effect on high school and college completion rates for boys than for girls, compounded by the harsher disciplinary response from schools.  
Boys are often viewed through a lens that expects more restlessness or behavioral challenges, and when they do not conform to the ""ideal student"" stereotype (which often aligns with typical female behavior like sitting quietly and following rules), they are more likely to be disciplined.  
Some research suggests that the large proportion of female teachers (especially in elementary schools) may contribute to this, as they may more easily identify with girls' behaviors and interests, while some boys may respond less to female authority figures. (U.S. News and World Report)

Everything I've listed and provided research for shows that every one of the disparity men have outweighed women, and every advantage, (primarily the actual law, where lives are ruined and spared) has outweighed men. Even the privilege you've listed that ""men earn more"" is not even equal to the fact that women who are aggressors of crime receive lesser sentences. Also men earning more isn't a privilege, a privilege is something that's unearned. Where have men not earned these wages?

  
The debate had a lot more girth to this, but this is all I will post on here. She has yet to respond. But this just pisses me off because the way she was going about it was constantly saying ""Nope, men privileged because men"" when the only privileges came minute to issues, and the issues came and outweighed hers. Anyways, yeah I'm pissed. But how'd I do?","**Location**

The Standard at Ann Arbor,"As a parent of a resident, I'd caution anyone looking at this property due to the high concentration of homeless. The proximity to the Beer Depot and gas station across the street are contributing factors. In addition, there's concentration across Packard given a community services facility. I've personally been accosted in the alleyway behind the building, moving our kid in. The homeless congregate, deal and consume drugs in alcoves of the building, and management has chosen to take no responsibility. A simple security guard would make a considerable difference. Buyer beware. Question about permission to cross state lines when you live very close to border? Hi all!
My husband and I are getting ready to start the foster process but he brought up a good point to consider.
We live in Michigan, very close to the Ohio border. We’re in Toledo multiple times a week for church, shopping, eating, the zoo, the childrens’ museum, etc, as Toledo is the closest “big” city to us. Alternatively we could drive up to Ann Arbor.
We understand that you need to obtain permission when you take a foster child out of state, but considering our current habits we were wondering if there was some sort of “permanent” permission that could be granted, or if trips like what we typically do (never overnight if that matters) would fall under the reasonable and prudent parenting standard (I really don’t know what all falls under that standard, especially this). Would it be a case by case thing with permission needed from the bio parents for each case and each trip out of state?
Also, if this makes us a poor fit for fostering at this time we completely understand and will revisit in a few years time.

Buyer beware. Michigan Tech Startup? Are you joking? - The true tech startup scene in Michigan / Ann Arbor Before writing this post, I literally search “Michigan Startups” on Reddit, There is 0 subreddit group result, The closest one is[ Ann Arbor Startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/annarborstartups/) with 22 subscribers and the last post was 2 years ago. Put into perspective, there is a subreddit group called [Michigan Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/michiganbeer/new/) with 5,000 subscribers and the last post was 10 hours ago

I think that can somehow give us a picture what the startup scene looks like in Michigan

Before sharing my tech startup experience, let me tell a little bit about myself. I am a software developer and moved to Michigan from California a couple of years ago. The reason for moving was for work at that time. I  had experience generating startup ideas, turning it to a product (software, or a mobile app) and running and growing to a sustainable business. I most of the times stay in Oakland County or Ann Arbor area.

&amp;#x200B;

***Let’s start with Smart Zone***

I assume if you are in the startup field in Michigan, you probably heard about [Smart Zone](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/globalassets/documents/reports/fact-sheets/mismartzonefactsheet.pdf) . It is basically a concept that the whole Michigan is divided into 20 areas and each area has a business service center to help ambitious entrepreneurs start or grow their businesses. Some of them even have an incubator program to provide you with some business and financial related seminars..

Ironically, if you are in tech such as software / mobile / internet, you are screwed, because none of these smart zone centers support a legit tech startup. Why? Because their goals are to increase job opportunities and support some native industries such as defense, automotive, mobility things. As a tech startup, you probably want to stay lean as long as possible and will not hire anyone besides paying yourself and your co-founders until you start making good money.

&amp;#x200B;

***Incubator / Accelerator***

Michigan surprisingly has accelerator programs. To name a few:  Desai and Sparks in Ann Arbor, Conquer in Lansing, and TechTown in Detroit

However, from the location, you may already figured these accelerators are tied to universities: U of M is in Ann Arbor, Michigan State University is in Lansing, Wayne State University is in Detroit. These programs are mostly for students in these universities or for their alumina. For other people, it is very hard to get in. Even if you get in, the outcomes will not be as good as you may think (more on this later) Also, to be honest, it is not worth the effort to try to get in when you have other great accelerators out there such as Y Combinator, AngelPad, TechStars which can truly help you grow, build relationship with investors and offer valuable advice.

&amp;#x200B;

***Investors and advisors***

Very straightforward, First, there are not many angel investors who actively look for startups to invest. There are some VC and I guess they gathered money from rich individuals like doctors, lawyers to fund some companies. Accelerators usually play the angel roles, but I got inside information that so many startups in the accelerators were founded by local university students and failed so quickly. Accelerators end up losing money.(That’s why you do not find many accelerators / incubator programs in Michigan, it is a losing-money business and they do not get the return on their investments)

VCs are super conservative, and most of them only invest in automotive, food, real estate, and other traditional business. I know a few who invest in tech company but only l

However, Nidoran have also become more common in other biome types of spawn points, so whether the Mountain biome is now easier or harder to distinguish remains to be seen.


**Summary**


In this analysis, I’ve compared all the data I could find on the Silph Road forums about the composition of various biomes to find out what biomes can be conclusively identified.


The only three threads I found with any kind of numerical data were:


[Pokemon Spawn Point Biomes &amp; where to look for rare pokemon.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/51h1xg/pokemon_spawn_point_biomes_where_to_look_for_rare/)


by *Glarblar*


[Lure Types (corresponding to biomes?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/52wmpf/lure_types_corresponding_to_biomes/)


by *EvolutionaryTheorist*


[Analysis: New Biome Blend Changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/5b5vkn/analysis_new_biome_blend_changes/)


by *joshwoodward*


Put together with what little data I’d managed to collect myself before the recent biome shift, it seems we can identify six different kinds of biomes:


*Three kinds of Common biomes*


All of which have at least 20% chance to spawn a Pidgey, but they can be distinguished by how often (or how little) they produce Rattata, Spearow, and Weedle.


Pokémon | Type 1:‘Grass’ | Type 2:‘Bush’ | Type 3:‘Forest’
:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:
Pidgey		|	30%	|	20%	|	20%
Rattata		|	30%	|	25%	|	&lt;5%
Weedle	|	&lt;2 %	|	15%	|	25%
Spearow	|	20%	|	&lt;5%	|	&lt;5%


*All* three types of Common Biome Spawn Points have around 10% chance to spawn a Pokémon from a ‘grab bag’: A list of dozens of Pokémon that all have a chance to spawn of less than 1%. 


*The Water biome*


Pokémon | Percentage	
:------------:|:----------------:
Magikarp	|	30%
Goldeen	|	15%
Staryu		|	15%
Psyduck	|	15%
Poliwag	|	15%
Slowpoke	|	7%
Dratini		|	2%


Which is the only type of biome which does not seem to have a ‘grab bag’. It spawns a water Pokémon 99% of the time.


Water biomes mostly appear near bodies of water.


*The Drowzee biome*


Pokémon | Percentage	
:------------:|:----------------:
Drowzee	|	45%
Zubat		|	10%
Jynx		|	5%
Gastly		|	5%
Krabby		|	5%


Which has a considerable ‘grab bag’: Almost 30% chance to spawn one of dozens of Pokémon who all have chances to spawn of less than 2%.


Drowzee biomes seem to appear in cities.


*The Mountain biome*


Pokémon | Percentage	
:------------:|:----------------:
Pidgey		|	13%
Weedle	|	13%
Eevee		|	10%
Clefairy	|	6%
Nidoran♂ 	|	6%
Nidoran♀ 	|	6%


Which might almost be seen as a fourth type of ‘Common’ biome, as only the presence of Clefairy and the increased presence of Nidoran makes it distinguishable.


Mountain biomes seem to appear at high altitudes.


*A seventh biome?*


I’ve read many anecdotal reports of a ‘Desert’ biome, which spawns a lot of fire and ground type Pokémon. Enough to believe this type of biome exists. However, I’ve not seen any kind of data from any spawn point of this biome, so it’s impossible to say anything meaningful about it.


I also hear many anecdotal suggestions of a second, *different* type of Water biome. One that apparently includes more Shellder and Krabby. But again I can’t find any quantified characterisation of any such biome.


**So does this answer your research question?**


Well, no, because all this data became outdated with last week’s Biome Shift. All I’ve learned now is what Pokémon *were* indicators of different biomes before last week.


However, it seems very likely that Niantic only changed the composition of the biomes, rather than making entirely new biomes. So knowing these six types of biomes existed before means we don’t have to start all over from scratch in identifying the new biomes!


**How can the Silph Road help?**


If you have any hard data on the Pokémon composition spawned by various spawn points, from before or after the biome shift, or know of any place where such data is published, please bring this data to me so I may compare it to the data I’ve already compared!


It’s crucial that this is quantitative data: Someone who has logged all the Pokémon that spawned from a spawn point for a sufficient number of spawn events, *including* all the ‘useless’ Pokémon that nobody bothers to catch.


“This spawn point very often spawns Ekans”, is sadly not useful. Neither is “I caught 10 Geodude from this spawn point” if you can’t tell me how many Spearows that spawn point spawned in the same time.


If you’d like to go out and gather info on the new situation, take a spawn point you very often check anyways, and make a log of every Pokémon that spawns from it, including the ones you don’t catch. Personally I take screenshots, only takes a second and doesn’t require me to invest time then and there, and then when I have time I go through my screenshots and write them all down.


I’d say you need *at the very least* 40 spawn events from a spawn point to be able to say *anything* meaningful about it at all. That’s the absolute minimum, and the more, the better.


Ofcourse, a dataset of a million spawn events like that of *joshwoodward* is extremely valuable, especially for noting subtle changes or finding out which biome is most likely to spawn the rarest Pokémon. 


But not all of us can put in that kind of data-mining effort. And it only takes about a 100 spawn events to be able to see if the biome at your location is the same as the biome in Ann Arbor, or not. And that may provide information on regional variances on top of the biomes, and allow us to find out what’s ‘constant’ across the world.","**Location**

The Villas at Main Street,"I have lived at Villas on Main Street for over a year and a half, and overall the experience was less than satisfactory. The location proved to be convenient, and the manager was very good at pointing the finger at owners of this apartment complex.
The maintenance staff are great but they have no say in recommendations for old inefficient equipment to be replaced. So the turnover of maintenance staff is high, because they don’t want to deal with the stress of tenants and the stress management puts on them to do repairs with limitations.

The manager of this establishment must get a great bonus every month from the owners to keep their cost down, by not replacing aging and inefficient appliances and equipment.
However, it's essential to note that the apartments showed signs of aging interior and exterior, despite some attempts at renovation. Issues like a rusty dishwasher and electric stove, sticky folding doors, poor window and door insulation, and a worn-out tub with wall tiles improperly installed were regular occurrences. Also not functioning bike racks, many pot holes throughout the community, not enough parking garages and parking line spaces have not been repainted for years, my apartment bedroom ceiling has reoccurring water leaks, poorly designed dog park. I must add due to hot weather this year, we had bee’s coming in through inside apartment vents
The maintenance team was responsive, but it became quite unpleasant to deal with the frequent need to request services due to the apartment's aging condition.

I would strongly recommend conducting a detailed move-in inspection and documenting with pictures any pre-existing borderline misfunctions or worn-out areas to avoid disputes with the management. Otherwise, they might attribute such issues as ""damages"" and request payment for replacements.

It’s definitely not a “LUXURY” apartment community, except for the price. While the place isn’t perfect, and due to my age and financial situation it is serving its purpose for now. Parking tips for Broadway Rave at The Blind Pig (Ann Arbor 11/21)   
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the broadway rave at the blind pig this friday. downtown ann arbor can be a real headache on a weekend night and you don't want to be late for this.  
  
honestly the best way to go is using an app like prked. you can rent a private driveway or garage right next to the blind pig. it's usually way cheaper than the public lots and you get to skip the nightmare of circling for a spot. you just park and walk over in a few minutes. its a lifesaver.  
  
if you dont go that route, your main option is the parking structure right across the street on first st. you can also try the surface lot on S First Ave and w Washington, which is super close. there are a bunch of other lots and structures nearby like the one at first &amp; huron or the one on ashley, all within a short walk.  
  
street parking is another option. the meters are free after 6pm which is great. but honestly, finding an open spot on a friday night is tough and you have to read the signs really carefully because the parking cops in ann arbor are no joke.  
  
no matter what you do, get there early. traffic gets crazy and the lots fill up fast, especially for a popular event. you'll save yourself a lot of stress by giving yourself extra time.  
  
hope this helps and have an awesome time at the rave Decent complex
The staff were all super friendly and the complex is beautiful. I didn't get a tour of the apartments but the clubhouse is nice and well maintained. There's a small gym in the clubhouse towards the front of the complex. There's also a little lounge area.
The pool is really nice however it was pretty dirty. I understand some debris from wind and weather but it looks as if it hasn't been cleaned in a few days.
Also, there were a lot of bees around the pool so that was very bothersome but I understand it's unavoidable sometimes.
There aren't any indoor pools/spas which is definitely disappointing since the summer season is ending soon.
The large bathroom stall doesn't lock but there are showers you can access in the women's locker room.
Personally, for an apartment claiming to be luxury, I don't agree with that title. I feel like it's decent and the staff are nice.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Slanek, Venlil Space Corps***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 29, 2136*

Dawn crept over the horizon, bringing light to Sillis’ supercontinent. Human forces milled near a water tower, which marked the border of a small settlement. Tilfish extermination officers were holding the populace hostage, and that eliminated the option of bombing this region. Our current plan was to flush the resistance out.

My heart pounded, as I rode with Marcel to the rendezvous point. The redhead had warned me that military canines were part of this operation. Fear of non-sapient predators seemed impossible to get over, but I was determined to try. Tyler had texted me videos of his dog, after the battle of Earth; it was clear the two species shared a bond.

*If the awful beasts are important to humans, I have to try. Being a ghastly predator doesn’t inherently make an animal bad.*

Marcel hopped out of our truck, and I bounded after him. The oxygen-rich environment helped numb my fear, which was a blessing. The dog was sitting among the UN pack, panting with its slobbery tongue. Its soulless eyes pinpointed me, and its ears perked up malevolently. That wasn’t even addressing the rotund fangs!

“Are you alright, Slanek? You look like you’re about to faint,” the vegetarian growled.

My tail drooped between my legs. “J-just…peachy.”

“He’s friendly, bud. These are

ppliances (placed in plain sight by the maintenance team), and piles of loose torn open trash bags.

This is a large community and to think that 4 small recycle dumpsters with only Mon/Wed/Fri pickups would be sufficient is beyond insanity. The weekend is peak demand and neither recycling nor trash are picked up.

***Everything else is true about the heating/cooling and lack of insulation being absolutely sub-par and incapable of keeping a livable temperature. I was forced to put of tons of heavy/insulated curtains on every window in order to somewhat improve the situation.

***Upon move-in, our washer and stove were beyond repair, non-functional, and absolutely filthy. The community manager (Samantha) claimed that the issues were ""cosmetic"" (without looking at them, and at her own admission, without maintenance knowledge) and tried to say no to replacing them. This was after maintenance came out multiple times over several weeks to attempt to service these trashy old appliances.

Sep 4 update: I'll continue to add time/date stamped photos to show how disingenuous Mgmt's response was. I have been calling/submitting maintenance/emailing property mgmt directly for 3+ months now...if they want to talk they know my email, if they want to find a partial solution, they simply need to schedule recycling pickup on Sunday. Parking tips for the Huskies game at the Big House (Ann Arbor 10/18/25) hey figured i'd share some parking advice for the washington game since i've been going to games at the big house for years and parking can be a real headache if you don't have a plan.  
  
honestly the best thing i've found recently is a website called Prked. you can rent a private driveway or a spot in someone's garage right next to Michigan Stadium. it's way cheaper than the big lots and you can find a spot on a side street that lets you skip all the insane post-game traffic chaos. you just book it on your phone and have a guaranteed spot waiting for you. it's a super short walk and you avoid the worst of the crowds.  
  
if you want to go the more traditional route, you have a few options. the big official lots are run by the university. a lot of these are permit-only so dont even bother unless you have a pass. for the public lots like the one at Pioneer High School right across the street, be prepared to pay a lot, probably like $75 or more, and prices can change. gates for day games open super early, sometimes 6 a.m., so if you want to tailgate, you need to get there. just know that getting out of those lots after the game can take forever. seriously, you'll be sitting in traffic on main street for a long, long time.  
  
speaking of traffic, they shut down a bunch of roads around the stadium three hours before kickoff. main street right in front of the stadium gets closed, and parts of Keech and Stadium Blvd get blocked off too. so if you're driving in, aim to get there early and know your route in advance. after the game, they turn main street into a one-way going south to get people to I-94, but it’s still a parking lot.  
  
another good move is to park downtown in one of the city structures and take the shuttle. the Ann Arbor transit authority runs the ""FootballRide"" shuttle that picks you up from different spots and drops you right at the stadium. it's cheap, only a few bucks, and saves you the stress of fighting for a spot near the stadium. you can enjoy the bars and restaurants downtown before and after the game too.  
  
you'll also see tons of people selling parking on their lawns in the neighborhoods around the stadium. these can be good options and sometimes cheaper than the big lots. just make sure they leave you enough room to get out and dont block you in.  
  
whatever you do, get there earlier than you think you need to. the whole area is a mess on game day.  
  
hope this helps and go blue! should be a great game. I have lived at Villas on Main Street for over a year and a half, and overall the experience was less than satisfactory.

Will update a review after my son moves in. Ann Arbor is falling apart. I don’t feel safe as a young woman walking the streets by myself anymore. I have lived here my whole life.  The people that are hanging out on the streets everyday, or that are homeless are becoming more and more aggressive. It doesn’t matter if you’re being a good person to these people or not their intentions are not good. I didn’t have any money to spare and I got called a stupid bitch as the person came after me because I didn’t have any money to share. The worst always happens to in the city when I walk alone. I have had old men come up to me and threaten to rip my bag off my shoulder because I didn’t have $2. Just for the record I am not an expensive looking person I dress and thrift store, clothing, and shop at Plato’s closet. 

 I am saying this out loud for any people that are walking the streets without the knowledge that things are changing very quickly in Ann Arbor. Don’t pull your money out and show people what you have if you do decide to help, and always travel with a buddy. I don’t know how to advocate for Ann Arbor becoming respectable again, or ways that we can help some of these people if they even want it. It’s incredibly unfortunate and sad to see happening in the city of Ann Arbor. I know there’s a lot more behind it, and my main point to this message is people be safe and always be aware of your surroundings even more then usual when you’re in this area. Apartment complex overall is good, a little pricey but that’s Ann Arbor for ya.

Unhinged racist/sexist harassment &amp; threatening behavior in Georgetown area of Ann Arbor, between 8:15-8:30 PM on Tuesday September 16. Posting for my friend who didn’t want to post on her account. I’m not sure how to add both video and pictures so I’ll add pictures in the comments —

TL;DR: My partner and I were walking on Hayes Drive in the Georgetown neighborhood this evening when we were followed and verbally assaulted by a stranger.

My partner and I were walking along Hayes Drive in the Georgetown area after dinner when a woman pulled up next to us. She was visibly upset and told us the car behind her was following her and the driver was being incredibly aggressive. Shortly after, a man driving a dark blue or dark gray Volkswagen Jetta pulled up and yelled at the woman, telling her she needed “to learn the driving laws of the land” and that she should “go back to her country.” We intervened and told him not to do that. He became aggressive toward us, calling us “dumb c*nts” as he sped off. We stayed with the woman for a bit until she felt comfortable to drive again. 

We continued on our walk only to see the man, now on foot, cross Hayes to confront us. He walked behind us, filming us, while he shouted racist, sexist things at us (“dumb c*nt” p*ssy, fat, ugly, foreign, pedophile etc.). It appeared that he was trying to provoke us into a physical fight with him. We kept trying to get away from him but he continued to follow us and verbally assault us for at least five minutes. Finally we were able to get distance between us and we made it home safely, but things felt very dicey the entire time. 

People who live in the Georgetown/Esch Park area should be aware that this person lives in the neighborhood. He was enraged and seeking a fight; I would be careful walking alone. 

Description: the guy was a white male in his early 20s, slim build, brown hair/eyes, wearing glasses, a red baseball cap, and dark gray t-shirt and black shorts. He drove a dark blue or dark gray Volkswagen Jetta sedan (years 2010-2017), with a vanity license plate that said “POSITIVE” or “POSITIV”. He has decals on the back of the car, one of the words we could decipher was “CASH.” Apartment complex overall is good, a little pricey but that’s Ann Arbor for ya.

Traver Heights Apartments,"Very helpful and assertive staff, maintenance issues fixed and they were very prompt and very polite. Debunking NIMBY arguments opposing development at 2525 Ann Arbor-Saline Saw the post earlier discussing the proposed development at 2525 Ann Arbor-Saline (next to the Whole Foods) and thought I’d share/debunk the NIMBY flyers I saw being hung around the area. They claim the project is not affordable (how many affordable units are on the empty field of grass?), not multi-family because it will contain studio, 1BR, and 2BR units (those are in incredibly high demand), will “destroy existing businesses” (it is an empty, unmaintained lot), will be a “renter’s hotel for sporting events” (it’s literally an apartment complex?), will “add to existing traffic congestion” (I live a block away, the traffic is fine), and will “harm the safety of our residential community” (we get it, slightly poorer people scare you). 

I included a picture of the lot they are fighting to preserve for good measure. If you’re worried about the loss of green space (not really that green), keep in mind there is a lovely park right across the street. If we can’t build apartments on literally empty lots near popular retail locations, how can we ever expect to solve the housing crisis? I rented a 2 bedroom, 2 bath apartment from Traver Heights for 1.5 years.  It proved to be a great fit for me.  The staff and residents are all very nice and considerate.  The apartment and grounds are clean and well maintained.  The couple of times I needed to submit a service request, the concern was addressed effectively and efficiently.  The first floor apartment stayed amazingly cool in the summer and the available AC rarely kicking on.  They were extraordinarily helpful when I was getting ready to vacate.  They extended my lease by 1 month, which provided me with the necessary time to pack and move my belongings.  In contrast, other apartments would have required me to either pay double rent for that 1 month or sign a new lease and forfeit the subsequent lease-breakage fee.  If I needed to lease an apartment again in the A2 area, 100% Traver Heights would be my go to. Small but practical apartment shared with gf in Ann Arbor, Michigan I’ve had a great experience living at Traver Heights. The property manager, Joe, has been exceptional—attentive, responsive, and proactive. When my heater stopped working, he had it replaced within a few hours, ensuring minimal disruption. He also arranged for a new dryer when the old one malfunctioned, making sure everything was handled smoothly.

Highly recommend Traver Heights! Housing Situation in Ann Arbor Hi everyone, I might be getting a job offer in the Ann Arbor area within a few weeks and would need to relocate there sometime in the September/October period.

ry beautiful and I think she is beautiful with them, she should be very proud of herself because she struggled through an immensely difficult period and overcame many hurdles throughout her life and she ended up on top of it all as a winner. I told her in my opinion she is a hero and she will always be my hero, the strongest and bravest person I've ever known.  She was really happy to hear that and so were my parents,  she said she's not feeling as bad about those scars as she was the previous days and she's ready to go to the beach again.
   
**tl;dr**: Broke up with my girlfriend, she's gone, apologised to my sister and family for having been a shit brother, they forgave me and now I look forward to spending the remaining two weeks with them.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**asymmetrical_sally**

&gt;Good for you, it took you a little while, but you got there in the end.  Doing the right thing isn't always immediately clear when you're in the thick of things, and emotion can cloud you.  

&gt;Even in your last post, you sound like a pretty good brother.  Your sister trusts you, she leaned on you when she was hurting, and you've admitted your mistakes and seem sincere in your promises not to repeat them.  I wish you and your family all the best moving forward.  

**OOP**

&gt;&gt;Thanks , I don't feel like a good brother though.  I know she trusts me a lot, and that's why it stings so much when I feel like I failed her.  It's like she puts this hope in me and imagines me to be a better brother than I really am, I just try to live up to be the best brother I can be, but sometimes I feel like she deserves a better brother than me who won't make these mistakes. 

**Black_Belt_Troy**

&gt;How did you go about sending your (ex)girlfriend back? You kind of glossed over that and I just can't believe she didn't have some kind of terrible remark to say when that went down.

**OOP**

&gt;&gt;I just told her that our relationship was over because of what she said and I can't tolerate someone attacking my sister.  She was upset but she didn't really try to defend herself, I think she understood the gravity of her actions and felt some remorse and sense that she had brought it on herself.  I gave her money for the trip back, it's a small price to pay for my sisters happiness.  At least we have 2 weeks still.

**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** 

**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7** The sound insulation in this apartment is extremely poor. Even normal walking from the second floor is unbearably loud on the first floor, and the creaking from the old wooden structure makes it very difficult to rest. Management has offered no solutions to address this issue — unless their only idea is to somehow stop your upstairs neighbors from walking. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone. Resident Participation Meeting for new affordable housing on William Street in Ann Arbor The Ann Arbor Housing Commission and Related Midwest are hosting a Resident Participation Meeting on Tuesday, June 4 at 6:00 PM (via Zoom) to share the updated site plan for the affordable housing development at 350 S 5th (aka the old Y lot) and would love your input.

This development will include 330 apartments, all of which will be affordable, targeting a range of incomes from 30% to 80% of Area Median Income (AMI) thanks to voter approval of an affordable housing mileage in 2022! The apartment complex is located in a quiet and nice neighborhood, within walking distance of the elementary school and grocery stores.

Uptown Ann Arbor,"I have been living at Uptown Ann Arbor for a year, and I absolutely love it here! The community is beautiful, peaceful, and very well maintained. The apartments are modern and comfortable, making it truly feel like home.

What makes the experience even better is the amazing leasing office team. Tyler and Tamara have always been kind, helpful, and professional. They are attentive to residents’ needs and always provide outstanding service.

I highly recommend Uptown Ann Arbor to anyone looking for a great place to live with a supportive and friendly staff. Michigan Conservatory Wedding: October 14, 2017, 78 people, $15k - Photos &amp; Summary plus Budget, Guest, and Alcohol Breakdowns Our wedding happened on Saturday and I am so happy! [Here are the sneak peeks from our photographer.](https://imgur.com/a/ICq5X) I'll post some of these individually when I'm talking about various elements in the recap below.

I underestimated how nervous I would be. The week leading up to it, I was a frantic mess. There were so many last-minute things to do, I felt like I was constantly going. And then the day of, I was excited, but since our venue was DIY and we didn't have a planner/coordinator, I just felt the pressure of so many moving parts. For the most part, it all came together, but it was nerve-wracking. My husband (!) felt the same.

To me, the best part was the [ceremony.](https://i.imgur.com/0XMGHHU.jpg) There was a moment right before I walked down the aisle, where the bridesmaids and groomsmen were behind all this greenery and I could see the white chairs with everyone seated, and everyone had flowers, and the string musicians were playing and it was all just so rich and lush and full and beautiful (and I thought *I am so glad we got the string musicians*). Our venue had a max of 100 people but some would have had to stand, so our final number of 78 was perfect - everyone had a seat but it still looked full. My favorite compliments about the wedding were the (several different!) people who told us it was the most beautiful ceremony they had seen/heard, and I'm proud of it - I think it struck the right balance of personal and ritualistic. His father walked him down the aisle, and both my parents walked me down. His sister walked down with his father's wife, placed a single white rose on an empty chair for their late mother, and officiated. SIL was awesome - she was a perfect mix of funny and serious and lots of people commented on what a great job she did. Aside from her welcome/intro, we wrote the whole ceremony ourselves. My husband is a published poet and I am ABD in English lit and taught it for years, so expectations were high, but I think we pulled it off. We printed a [found poem](https://i.imgur.com/6J3zZDC.png) that is fragments of poetry about love through history and attached it to the program, which SIL/officiant referred to in her opening; we had one of my friends read a [selection from Wendell Berry's ""Poetry and Marriage""](https://i.imgur.com/JuzojXY.png) and a bridesmaid read [Denise Levertov's ""About Marriage.""](http://april-is.tumblr.com/post/21863513120/april-26-2012-about-marriage-denise-levertov) (Seriously, if you are looking for selections, read these, they are so beautiful!) We did a wine ceremony. We read structured affirmations to each other (e.g. we each answered ""What everyone knows about you is [x],  but also, [y]"" and other prompts like it) and then the vows we wrote together for the ring ceremony. 

My friends and family were amazing. My mom, dad, FIL, and SMIL went an hour and a half or so early to set up decor alongside the caterers (who set up the tables, chairs, bar, and centerpieces), and did a beautiful job. My friend who loaned us the sound equipment was basically the sound guy and kept things running smoothly. I had been nervous about people dancing with no DJ and just the Spotify playlists I put together, but it was great - our photographer told us we had ""the BEST playlists!"" and I think almost the whole wedding was on the floor for ""Uptown Funk"" and just about every couple for ""I Can't Help Falling in Love With You."" My bridesman was a great MC, introducing the speeches and formal dances. And of course my sister-in-law was an awesome officiant. And it was great hanging out with [my bridespeople and SIL](https://imgur.com/pQkUsl0) on the day of - we basically took over a salon in town, they let us have champagne and a private room, and it was just really fun.

The koozie favors were a surprising hit! I mean, a lot of people didn't take them, but a few of our friends were all ""these are such a good favor! So useful!"" Our rule about putting our names and dates on a favor is that if it's a thing you might have a company name on, it's fine - so I think it passed that bar.

Also, I loved my eucalyptus head wreath! The florist did a great job with it. I had planned to take it off after the ceremony, but ended up wearing it all night.

Things that went wrong: 

1. It rained all day, which sucked. We had an indoor wedding largely because we know Michigan weather in fall is unpredictable, but it meant we couldn't take outdoor photos on the grounds of the botanical gardens or really make use of the fall color. We snuck in our [first look](https://imgur.com/G9U9hKc) outside before it started again, but that's it. 

2. The cocktail hour was supposed to be in the Conservatory, where we had the reception, but apparently our point person at the caterer didn't communicate well with her team and they set up the bar in the reception space and failed to move the ceremony chairs. Which meant that everyone sort of hung out in the lobby between the two for cocktail hour, which is like a gift shop/front desk with some tables and chairs. Not ideal.

3. The speeches were really long, and the caterers waited until they finished to start serving dinner, even though I had wanted them to serve it during speeches. The high school friends contingent of the groomsmen were supposed to gi

G to become a resident.  Every unit shown to us was STUNNING!   Unfortunately, the person who styled the units we saw has retired. But I have high hopes that their current interior designer will bring similar delightfulness in decor.

VERVE Ann Arbor Apartments,"I moved into Verve this fall and have had an amazing experience! One of the employees, Casey Vigo, has especially gone above and beyond for the residents and is incredibly supportive and knowledgeable! 10/10! Questions for an upcoming trip to Ann Arbor. Looking forward to our trip to Ann Arbor to see a concert at Michigan Stadium. Have never been.

Flying into Detroit. Not sure where to stay. Ann Arbor or Plymouth because it's cheaper by half?

Main concern about getting a rental, or relying on Uber/Lyft to get around. I can read a map and see how far apart things are, but wondering how prevalent ride share services are in these areas. I've been to places and have been surprised how few cars there are.

How is parking around the stadium? If I had a rental could I park away from the stadium and walk safely at night? Just no idea. Verve apartments is always clean and well-maintained, but what really sets this place apart is the staff—especially Casey Vigo. She has been so helpful from the very beginning and is incredibly friendly, professional, and always willing to go above and beyond. It’s rare to find someone so genuinely dedicated to making residents feel comfortable and cared for. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great home and exceptional service! Is there anywhere that’s just Ann Arbor 2.0?  Looking into places to live post grad. I love Ann Arbor- it’s walkable with good public transportation. I like the mixture of housing of multi-unit houses and apartment buildings. After living in a tiny town, a big metro city, I just can’t imagine anywhere as perfect as Ann Arbor. Beautiful, new apartment building with a great on-site coffee shop! My daughter lives here and absolutely loves it. The staff is always friendly and welcoming, and the whole place has such a warm, inviting vibe. The greenery throughout the building is gorgeous, and the amenities are truly impressive.

Apartment listings always put their best foot forward so just getting an idea if there’s any that should be avoided. I moved into Verve in August and have had an awesome experience! One particular employee, Casey V.,  has made my time nothing short of incredible. She has always answered my many questions with a smile on her face and all the helpful information I need. I love stopping by the leasing office to speak with her whenever I have a concern. Thank you Casey and all of the other Verve staff for always being so kind! Housing Situation in Ann Arbor Hi everyone, I might be getting a job offer in the Ann Arbor area within a few weeks and would need to relocate there sometime in the September/October period.

Thanks in advance!

Also: I know sometimes there is a disconnect between Zillow prices and what is on the ground. how much would you expect a studio/one-room rent to be in the Ann Arbor area?

Not good.

Luckily, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox, but they start with building more housing to increase the vacancy rate. New market-rate developments pay significantly more in property taxes, money that is needed for many things (schools, water, police, fire, mental health, parks, The Ride, etc.) but for this discussion, funds are now being used to build 63 [affordable units in Kerrytown](https://avalonhousing.org/avalon-ann-arbor-housing-commission-break-ground-on-dunbar-tower/), and soon 330 [right above Blake Transit Center](https://archive.is/g1tQT). These units are set aside for those making 80% of area median income or less.

The more market rate housing that we build, the more money from property taxes we will have to build affordable housing. We did the hard part by passing the Affordable Housing Millage in 2020 and we're now starting to see real progress.

If we ""Pause the Plan,"" we press Play on unaffordability, sprawl, rent surging, and homelessness getting worse.

TL;DR: support Neighbors for more Neighbors to help reduce homelessness in our great city! Beautiful, new apartment building with a great on-site coffee shop! My daughter lives here and absolutely loves it. The staff is always friendly and welcoming, and the whole place has such a warm, inviting vibe. The greenery throughout the building is gorgeous, and the amenities are truly impressive. Highly recommend!

Ann Arbor Apartment How are the Manchester Flat Apartment and the ParkPlace/Hillcrest apartment? Is it safe in the area? What utility does it include? Any mold issue? I moved into Verve this fall and have had an amazing experience! One of the employees, Casey Vigo, has especially gone above and beyond for the residents and is incredibly supportive and knowledgeable! 10/10! Ann Arbor is falling apart. I don’t feel safe as a young woman walking the streets by myself anymore. I have lived here my whole life.  The people that are hanging out on the streets everyday, or that are homeless are becoming more and more aggressive. It doesn’t matter if you’re being a good person to these people or not their intentions are not good. I didn’t have any money to spare and I got called a stupid bitch as the person came after me because I didn’t have any money to share. The worst always happens to in the city when I walk alone. I have had old men come up to me and threaten to rip my bag off my shoulder because I didn’t have $2. Just for the record I am not an expensive looking person I dress and thrift store, clothing, and shop at Plato’s closet. 

 I am saying this out loud for any people that are walking the streets without the knowledge that things are changing very quickly in Ann Arbor. Don’t pull your money out and show people what you have if you do decide to help, and always travel with a buddy. I don’t know how to advocate for Ann Arbor becoming respectable again, or ways that we can help some of these people if they even want it. It’s incredibly unfortunate and sad to see happening in the city of Ann Arbor. I know there’s a lot more behind it, and my main point to this message is people be safe and always be aware of your surroundings even more then usual when you’re in this area. I moved into Verve this fall and have had an amazing experience!

The George's new building: ""54 new apartments, retail space proposed on Packard Street in Ann Arbor"" Verve apartments is always clean and well-maintained, but what really sets this place apart is the staff—especially Casey Vigo. She has been so helpful from the very beginning and is incredibly friendly, professional, and always willing to go above and beyond. It’s rare to find someone so genuinely dedicated to making residents feel comfortable and cared for. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great home and exceptional service! Housing Situation in Ann Arbor Hi everyone, I might be getting a job offer in the Ann Arbor area within a few weeks and would need to relocate there sometime in the September/October period.

I understand that Ann Arbor is a college town and thus many of the residences/apartments would be already filled. Would getting a suitable \[i.e. not roach infested\] apartment in a reasonably safe locality (no crime etc) be doable in the September/October 2024 period in the Ann Arbor area?

Thanks in advance!

Also: I know sometimes there is a disconnect between Zillow prices and what is on the ground. how much would you expect a studio/one-room rent to be in the Ann Arbor area?

Valley Ranch Apartments,"Very nice and spacious apartments, clean and quiet location, and close to University of Michigan campus. It was a great experience working with our leasing consultant Jasmine, who arranged the tours for the apartments and helped us finalize the apartment we will be moving into soon. She was very patient and courteous. Highly recommended! LL Bean coming to Ann Arbor? I may be breaking some news here. I can’t find anything online about this. They’re updating signage at Briarwood right now and they’ve got LL Bean and Dick’s listed on the sign. We just moved into Valley Ranch Apartments, and so far, we’re really happy with our decision! The community is clean, quiet, and feels very safe. The staff has been helpful and welcoming throughout the move-in process. Maintenance responded quickly to our requests, and everything was handled smoothly. The apartment itself is spacious and well-maintained, with a nice layout and modern amenities. Looking forward to making this place home! Thanks. Ann Arbor landlords charging renters over $6,000 to get in line for apartments Just when you thought renting couldn’t get worse, how about $6,000+ up front just to be in line for a place? Maintenance here feels like an endless cycle of band-aid fixes rather than real repairs which just drags out the issue.  My AC unit was broken for a month this summer during the hottest heatwaves (100F+) and despite multiple visits from maintenance it took them over a month to fix.  I felt no sense of urgency or accountability from management.  Now, hundreds of bees swarm my hallways daily, and despite multiple calls from me and a neighbor, the issue remains unaddressed and the hallways are littered with dead bees.  This has turned our shared space into an anxiety inducing buzzard hazard.  On top of that, a neighbor's broken-down junk car has sat in the lot for over seven months, dragging down curb appeal and perceived value of the complex.

Despite multiple issues, rent goes up by at least $100 each year even if you're a good tenant and they won't even negotiate. ALERT: A Spoilermaker Watch has been issued in Ann Arbor, MI for Saturday 11/4/23 With a week off under their belts following their cathartic win over the rival Michigan State Spartans, the Michigan Wolverines roll into week 10 sitting at 8-0 and ranked 2nd in the AP Poll. However, lurking up next for the Wolverines are the unranked Purdue Boilermakers who have their second chance in as many years to add another unsuspecting top 5 team to their ever-growing list of victims. Will Purdue keep its hopes of bowl eligibility alive or will Michigan continue its seemingly unstoppable march towards Indianapolis?

2 years ago I shared my findings on [Purdue's history of upsetting top 5 teams while unranked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/qdj3g5/the_anatomy_of_a_spoilermaker/) with you fine folks and noted a few trends I had noticed along the way. While the Boilermakers have struggled thus far this year, the program is known for upending the season of Top 5 teams. Not only is this Purdue’s second straight crack at knocking off the top 5 Wolverines in as many years, Michigan also comes in ranked 2nd, which are the Spoilermakers most frequent victims, sporting a 5-7 record.

**Series Notes**

The last time top 5 Michigan took on unrakned Purdue was in Indianapolis in the Big Ten Championship game as the Wolverines clinched their ticket to the playoffs against a Purdue team coached by a Jeff Brohm with one foot already out the door on the way to Louisville. Historically, Michigan is unranked Purdue's 2nd most frequent top 5 opponent with 12 prior meetings with Purdue sporting a 2-10 record over these meetings. The Spoilermakers have not knocked off a top 5 Michigan team since 1976 when the Boilermakers defeated the top ranked Wolverines 16-14. Top 5 Michigan has lost to unranked Purdue once in 6 tries in Ann Arbor, falling to the Spoilermakers 21-20 in 1964. Those Wolverines would go on to finish 9-1 with a Big Ten Championship, a Rose Bowl victory, and would finished ranked 4th while Purdue finished unranked. 

**ALERT:**

A Spoilermaker Watch has been issued as conditions are favorable for the development of another unranked Purdue upset over a top 5 team. Michigan has looked nearly unstoppable thus far this year, will the winning ways continue within the friendly confines of the Big House? 
Or will the scandal embroiled Wolverines get caught napping ahead of a trip to Happy Valley? Purdue Pete has not knocked off a top 5 team since 2021. Is he still satisfied or does he hunger for another teams dreams? Only time will tell as he is always watching, always waiting, [always ready for his next victim.](https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1317/2021/08/24134721/GettyImages-1052196406-818x460.jpg) Maintenance here feels like an endless cycle of band-aid fixes rather than real repairs which just drags out the issue.

That's a huge drop in the collateral backing all that margin debt.  Is it enough to cause the Mother of all Margin Calls (MMC) and set off the worst crash since 1929?  Nope.  Not yet.  But it's coming.  Remember how people pointed out on AMZN's last ER how they were actually super fuk?  Yeah, you know who had a supposedly positive ER but is actually super-mega-fuk and just lied through their teeth about it? Apple.  AAPL doesn't have a single factory working right now, and their by far #1 market - China - is in the midst of complete economic collapse.  &gt;!(the politburo doesn't have emergency meetings about giant spending packages because things are going well)!&lt;  They gave zero guidance on either of these things, which makes me think that it's even worse than I think it is, and I think it's fucking horrible.  But back to the bad Chinese debt. The reason Wall Street can survive a hit to something like AMZN and the indexes is that they're hedged to the balls for stuff like that.  Know what they're not hedged for?  Chinese property bonds universally going to zero.

So what happens when the collateral for those margin loans goes down?  I'm sure you retards behind Wendy's have all heard this one before - you get a margin call.  First, you (or more likely your broker) sells equities.  But if equities are all dropping, they comin' for that money, and they're looking at your assets to get it.  Guess what?  Housing and commercial real estate are both assets they can force sales on.  So that same self-reinforcing spiral that drove up both equity and real estate prices?  It's going to go into reverse, but here's the thing, when everyone is selling at the same time, prices go down really, really, really, really, really, really fast.

We learned this last time in 2008.  This time, because the housing market is directly tied to the crashing stocks, instead of indirectly through people who will default over time as they lose their jobs or balloon payments come due or rates adjust, it's going to happen all at once, faster and more violently.  We actually got a brief preview of what this is going to look like thanks to the wild incompetence and greed at Zillow - Z.  Their stock crashed 40% in five days when it was revealed they'd bought too many houses they couldn't rent or flip and had to sell them at a loss.  And that was just a couple of neighborhoods in Arizona.  When this hits nationwide, it's going to be exponentially worse.

How much worse?  Well, that depends on where you are.  Here's some graphs explaining that while the US is fuk, somehow our Maple Swiling neighbors to the north are exponentially worse off - life lesson, don't tie yourself to China kids.

This is bad, but it's kind of hiding how bad because the data cuts off too soon after the COVID crash.

https://preview.redd.it/1a7gdtqnvqw81.jpg?width=390&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24ee392a123437c1faaa9e70f954a727a7ce384e

Yeah, Canada.. I'm sorry maple's.  It's gonna be rough.  Good luck, and care with RBC, pretty sure that between a huge position in Chinese debt and an incredible number of soon to be bad mortgages and margin loans they're completely worthless.

https://preview.redd.it/u1mjb2zovqw81.jpg?width=461&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed1d0dac92c4298a91694cdd14465e021d834432

Look, I started writing DD's last fall saying we'd just gone into recession but nobody noticed and everyone laughed at me and said I was crazy.  After that Q1 GDP miss it looks a bit different, ya?  Last summer I wrote about how CMBS was fuk and it would start coming due in March 2022, and people pointed and laughed.  See the chart earlier in this post.  Now I'm telling you that the banks and the Fed and every fucking person has fucked up and missed that real estate and equities have gotten tied up in a gordian knot that's getting sucked into a black hole of failure.  I'd like to be wrong.  I've been wrong before (see my terrible takes on corporate hedging of HYG for an example), but I don't think I'm wrong here.  

The market and housing and everything is going down like Anne Robbins trying to get off the Hollywood black list.  I've never given dates before because I didn't have a good enough idea of when things would finally hit a critical mass.  If we keep following the 2008 chart (thanks for being predictable algorithms!) we're going to go up for a couple of weeks then crash sometime between the end of May and the middle/end of July.  Summer collapses are historically rather rare, so I like this fall myself, but I wouldn't be surprised by either outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** **In 2008, the unknown weapons of financial mass destruction were sub-prime loans, MBS, CDS, and CDOs.  In 2022 they're margin loans, asset backed loans, Chinese bonds, and ""cash"" purchased assets.**

This is how inflation leaked into the real economy from the assets it was supposed to be segregated in.  Fed printer goes brrrrr --&gt; assets inflate --&gt; margin loans against assets drive up real estate --&gt; owners of real estate suddenly have lots of extra money --&gt; inflation.

As of November of '21, the Fed had printed $13 Trillion since the start of COVID.  $1 Trillion was stimmies.  The rest?  The rest went to the rich via inflated asset prices and debt purchases.  Don't believe them when they try to blame this shitshow on stimmies and the just now conveniently-mentioned-in-the-media ""return of sub-prime loans"" bit.  They just want a chance to blame this on poor people and immigrants to avoid having anyone look at them.  And don't think JPow's greedy ass can save you this time, to match the financial impact of what the Fed did during COVID they'd have to print nearly $60 Trillion.  That's Weimar Republic territory, if we're not headed there already.

Sleeping Ann Arbor Man Rescued After Being Run Over by Train From the Ann Arbor Fire Department’s Facebook page:

TECHNICAL RESCUE - PERSON STUCK UNDER TRAIN - On August 26, 2024 at 9:37 PM, AAFD, shift 2, citywide responded to the Ann Arbor Railroad tracks between Huron and Miller. Firefighters arrived to find a 20-year-old male patient who had been sleeping on the tracks when a north bound AARR freight train ran over him. The train was traveling at a very slow speed and was able to stop within a relatively short distance. The patient’s left hand was entangled in the rear axle of the lead locomotive. The hand was pinned between the wheel, axle, and wear gear. The patient was laying in between the rails under the locomotive. Shockingly, the hand injury was the only major trauma. Due to the patient’s location combined with strength of the metal of this part of the locomotive, extrication efforts were incredibly challenging. As the incident approached the one-hour mark, AAPD drove out the flight crew from Survival Flight along with a surgical team from U-M Dept of Surgery in preparation for a possible field amputation. At the 110-minute mark, extrication was successful. The patient was transported by HVA to U-M Hospital in stable condition. 

This was a once in career incident for those involved. Normally, person versus train incidents are fatal. This was a true team effort.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the volleyball match against usc on 11/28 at 2:00 pm. parking around crisler center can be a real pain, especially when the official lots fill up or the traffic is backed up on stadium boulevard.  
  
honestly the easiest thing i've found recently is this site called Prked. people who live right next to crisler center rent out their private driveways and garages. you can book a spot ahead of time and it's usually way cheaper than the cash lots and lets you skip all the traffic chaos getting into the main entrance areas. it's just a short walk over to the arena.  
  
if you want to stick with the official university options, for women's volleyball games they usually offer \*\*free parking\*\* in the blue lot, which surrounds crisler center itself (lots sc4, sc5, sc6, and sc7). the entrances are on stadium boulevard and east keech avenue (off south main street). this is the absolute best deal, but it is first-come, first-served.  
  
if the free blue lot is full, you'll need a backup plan. the main paid options are: pioneer high school (accessible off main street at stadium blvd), which usually charges $10. people say pioneer is super easy in and out, but be aware that there have been reports of car break-ins around there during games, so don't leave anything valuable visible. ann arbor golf &amp; outing, directly across stadium boulevard, sometimes has parking for $20. there are also smaller university lots like sc2, sc32, sc35, and sc36 that act as overflow, usually for around $10 to $20, and you’ll need to confirm if they are credit card only or accept cash.  
  
as far as street parking goes, 11/28 is the day after thanksgiving, which the city observes as a free parking holiday for all metered spots. this is nice if you're willing to walk from downtown, but be very careful about the residential neighborhoods close to the stadium. most of those streets are permit-only (rpp) and ann arbor is not shy about handing out tickets. for any free street parking you find, expect at least a half-mile walk to the center. look north of stadium, west of main, or east of state for the best chances.  
  
a final tip: allow yourself plenty of time, because traffic on stadium blvd and main street still gets backed up closer to the 2:00 pm game time. also, remember that crisler center is a tobacco-free campus and all concessions are cashless and contactless. they also have a clear bag policy for entry.  
  
hope this helps you avoid a ticket and get to the game easily. go blue! Don't live here. The rent is a little high but that's honestly not the worst thing at Vic. The staff is the worst especially the office manager. Simple paperwork take forever to be completed and is sometimes filled out incorrectly, which just leads to more paperwork and more waiting.

- Cleaning issue was not promptly addressed by management

**Price/Value**
- Rent is described as ""a little high""
- Mixed value perception: Some recommend Vic Village, others believe better places exist for the money

Vic Village South,"Great place, right across the other one with a good gym Massive $469 million ‘Arbor South’ development plan gets green light The massive Arbor South development at State Street and Eisenhower Parkway, set to bring more than 1,000 residential units to Ann Arbor, has been given the green light to move forward with construction.

The Ann Arbor Planning Commission approved final plans for the project at its meeting Tuesday evening, June 17. I strongly do not recommend choosing this apartment. Because of the guarantor issue, I was told by email that I had to pay 1.5 times the room rate or use Leap. But I had already found another place to live, so at the beginning of May I sent an email to cancel the contract. . But the office said there was nothing they could do, even if I was willing to pay without a deposit, there was nothing they could do. The rent for this apartment is so high that it is difficult to sublet it. I later found someone who could sublet my contract, and it was stated at the beginning that it was a girl, but it was not until before signing the contract that a girl could not sublet my contract, and they would prepare a new one for her. During this period, the girl and I basically didn't reply to emails we sent. I had to call around 11 o'clock every day before someone answered. And every time I responded, I had to discuss it with my supervisor and the result was nothing. This matter has been delayed until now and has not been resolved.

See Inequality Media, Robert Reich, Heather Cox Richardson, Stacie Abrams, #SistersInLaw, Strict Scrutiny. Past resident and local here! Loved living at Vic as it's the closest apartment to central campus, near the Diag and multiple restaurants some of which stay open late for students coming back from the library or need to get food after partying. It's also very close to multiple bus stops (including the CCTC) for residents that need to commute to North Campus or anywhere across campus.

Overall, conveniently located and also has state-of-the-art amenities! Anyone know if the raising canes under new Vic Village opening in the fall? Couldn’t find anything else online. I am a parent with a child leasing and  had the most amazing experience with Andrea Crites. She walked me through everything and made it so seamless. It so nice to deal with such professional people!

This is the 3rd in my series of transit maps ([1st is SF](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransitDiagrams/comments/14isyu3/muni_metro_fantasy_map_id_love_feedback_and/), [2nd is East Bay](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransitDiagrams/comments/1aikq7w/ac_transit_with_a_metro_fantasy_map_id_love/)) and I'd love some input on this one! Some initial things I've been wrestling with were:

 - Which natural areas should or shouldn't be included?
 - Would it be nice or distracting to add small illustrations to go along with the natural areas (like a small mountain icon for mountains)

Any other general feedback with the stop selection, line alignment, art, or anything else is greatly appreciated! The various bay area subreddits and transit subreddits have been great places to have discussions and get feedback, so thank you all for that!","**Location**

Villas at Northstar,"Poorly maintained. Maintenance was in and out of my apartment often with no notice or explanation as to why maintenance staff were in my home.  Had to file a police report and install a camera for the no notice, illegal, visits.

Manager attempted, and failed, to ding my credit report claiming I never returned the keys with a “key fee”.  Ridiculous because I had a confirmation email stating the keys were returned.

Exterior panels on building missing.  Emailed manager many times, manager states “unable to get anyone out.”  Really?  The missing panels have been like that for years.  See pictures attached.

Woodbury Gardens Apartments & Townhomes,"The worst managment you can think of.
Although they hold a valuable place with very nice people coming to live there, the only thing the managment cares about is monrey and follow thier rules.
We got endless emails from the managment that things in the backyard must be collected back home (these things belong to babies playing outside...) and that a violation of the rules is against the place expected behavior 🤷
The best part comes when you leave the place! We gave a notice of 40 days to the managment that we are not renewing the rental. It was not enough, and they have been charging us for 20 days rental, as the RULE says it has to be 60 days.
Needless to say that our place was rented to others within a week after we left, but.... a rule is a rule in Woodbury, and money to the managment ia above all other things 🤑🤑
Better not to do business with people who dont care much about you but more about your wallet My husband and I don’t have a garden as we live in an apartment. We do have a small balcony however and this was our first attempt at growing potatoes. Lived here from December 2020 to June 2023.

Some pros and cons from my experience:


1. Well maintained: It is not a brand new apartment complex, but it is pretty well taken after, so never had any major issues, both in my unit and in general. They also undergo a few updates now and then.
2. Just the right distance from school: It took me just over 20 minutes to get to Ross on foot one way, which is not that terrible in my opinion. There are also buses for downtown on both Industrial and Packard sides. I liked that I wasn't right by the school with a whole lot of noise. I didn't take advantage of the free shuttle that much because the schedule didn't fit me very well.
3. Zipcars: I do not own a car, but  there are a couple of Zipcars by the clubhouse, which was a huge plus for me. Was one of the deciding factors in making me live here.
4. Staff: Both the managing staff in the clubhouse and the maintenance crew are generally nice. Both move in and move out were very smooth.


1. Rent: Now there are other newer places with much higher rent in town, but I would not describe this place as affordable.   I locked in really low rent during Covid, but otherwise probably wouldn't have been able to afford this place.
2. Occasional power outages: Yes there are power outages due to storms, etc., but there were also a couple of isolated power outage incidents in my building, possibly due to the wildlife messing with the equipment or it being outdated.

These are all I can think of now, but will keep updating if something comes to mind. Measles exposure at U of M In a horrible twist of irony, immediately after Washtenaw County health officials confirmed that the previous measles report was a false alarm, this came through an email today. VACCINATE YOUR GODDAMN KIDS.

TL;DR-- Measles exposure took place at North Quad, IM Sports Complex, North Quad, and several other off-campus locations listed below.   


Greetings, U-M Ann Arbor students (and identified family), faculty and staff,

An international visitor to the U-M Ann Arbor campus – who has now returned home  – was confirmed today as having measles.

**Anyone who visited the following campus locations on these dates should monitor themselves for rash with fever or other symptoms consistent with measles over the next couple of weeks**:

* Intramural Sports Building on April 1, 3 and 4
* North Quad Complex on April 3
* Angell Hall Courtyard Computing Site (the Fishbowl) on April 4 and 5   

Exposure may have also occurred in off-campus locations. For details see [https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=513](https://www.washtenaw.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=513)

Measles is a highly contagious rash illness caused by a virus. Symptoms typically begin with high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. A rash breaks out 3 to 5 days after symptoms begin.  If you develop measles symptoms, especially rash and fever:

* Contact a health care provider as soon as possible. Currently enrolled students on the Ann Arbor campus may call UHS at 734-764-8320, day or night.
* Do not expose others, for example by riding a bus or socializing.

For prevention, make sure you are vaccinated. MMR is a recommended childhood vaccine, and two doses provide about 97% protection against measles. You are considered immune to measles if you received two MMR doses. You’re also considered immune if you had measles or were born before 1957.

You can also protect yourself and others from measles and other respiratory infections by following these steps:

* Cover your cough and clean your hands frequently
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands
* Avoid sharing saliva, e.g. sharing cups and eating utensils, and kissing

rt, she said. “It’s not the price of the rent, it's the utilities,” which she said always exceed $140 a month during the winter.

And then there was the time that their two sons couldn’t get out of their bedroom because of a broken doorknob, the leaking basement that still hasn’t been fixed in a year despite four tries by maintenance

To Jack Costello, this sounds like belly-aching.

“Are they roofing experts? I think they’re just looking for something to complain about, ” he said.

Costello said that the bugs “...could be indicative of the lifestyle the (unnamed couple) have, or of the people who were there before,” he said. “We won't rent a big-infested apartment. We just won’t.”

Tom Froster didn’t list bugs as major problem, but there were plenty of others. For example, Forster said the storm windows on his front door was pried off in February, making the front room resemble a walk-in refrigerator.

After repeated complaints to the management “We just got it repaired a couple of weeks ago,” he said.

When informed of Forster’ s complaint, Costello replied, “The front storm is just out of left field…. That is very hard for me to believe.”

Costello said that the response time to most complaints is 24 hours.

That may be so, but Forster is moving to Pinckney, where he c;aims he'll get more apartment

for his dollar. In his view, Ann Arbor is becoming overrun with landlords who care only about money, not the well-being of their tenants. They can afford this kind of attitude, Forester believes, because they don’t have to worry about tenants leaving after their leases expire. The market is so tight that others are always available to fill the vacancies.

In short, Ann Arbor residents are becoming the victims of the city’s desirability.

“Ann Arbor is a real cultural mecca, a real desirable place to live. But I doubt whether this will

continue to be true,” Forster said. “Living in Ann Arbor is becoming prohibitively expensive.”

“This (Pittsfield Village) is a place where people with lower incomes tend to gravitate to,” he said.

But providing housing for the poor was never the intention of Pittsfield, said Costello. Rents

were low only because the market was weak, he said. Things are different now.

“It (Pittsfield) was never designed for low-income housing,” he said. “There are places for them (low-income people) to live. There’s low-income housing in Ann Arbor.""

Costello said he sympathizes with people who can’t afford the increased rent. But in Ann Arbor’s competitive marketplace, he said, McKinley can’t afford to lag behind.

“Rents in Ann Arbor are competitive. For people to say this is rip-off city…they don’t understand the marketplace,” he said.

Forster understands that in August we will be paying $410 a month rent if he hasn’t already moved. Two years ago the rent was $326, he said.

“These days, I don’t sense any humanity at all in the people I’m dealing with. To them it’s just a Job, ""he said. “The only thing these people are interested in is the profit motive. All They're interested in is getting the most money they can.”

That’s not true either, said Costello.

“When we took it (Pittsfield Village) over, we had 300 backlogged work orders out of a 422-unit property,” he said. “In six months, we processed 1,110 work orders.”

“Let me give an idea of a work order,” Costello said. “Someone calls and says ‘I’ve got a leak in my sink.’ Minutes later, it’s fixed. *That’s* a work order,” he said.

We searched and contacted countless apartments in Ann Arbor before our move there (first time living in AA and MI as we are not from there). We ended up renting with WGA for a year (lived at the 1960 building, which is by South Industrial Highway) and we cannot recommend Woodbury Gardens enough. From the very beginning, they were on top of things.

We rented a more outdated, pet friendly unit (all the appliance were old but they were in excellent working condition) and we were happy with it. If you prefer to pay more, they also offer renovated units. The unit was spacious and had lots of natural light. Maintenance requests (e.g., closet doors popping out, bathtub glazing, etc.) were always answered promptly. Management and staff are very responsive and overall, pretty solid human beings!

The neighbourhood complex is very well maintained (seriously, I’ve never seen more perfect grass). They also just redid the parking lots last month. There is a dog park (very clean), tennis courts, a basketball court, playground and the Club House has lounge areas, office spaces, kitchens, a gym, an outdoor pool, BBQ spaces, free wifi, coffee/tea/snacks etc. for UM football games, they have tailgating events that serve free grub! The street parking usually gets jam-packed by folks going to the football games, but is otherwise very open and accessible (there’s plenty of parking behind your specific building anyway).

Besides all this, we loved that groceries stores, liquor stores, CVS, gas stations, highway, Target, Whole Foods, etc were all nearby. Drives to downtown often took 6-10 minutes depending on traffic. We never had issues with excess noise (or any noise at all to be honest).

We will surely miss living in such a beautiful, green space. Thank you WGA for making our first stay in AA / Michigan so wonderful! [James Drucker] Manchester United remain £13m apart in valuation with Newcastle for Dan Ashworth compensation. Ratcliffe has proposed a £2m in compensation despite Newcastle paying Brighton £4m in 2019. Ashworth's gardening leave is due to end in late 2025.","**Location**

Woodland Mews,"Awesome location and this is what undoubtedly makes the high price. Awesome very friendly office staff and now also maintenance staff. This makes a big difference for me after living 16 years somewhere else in Ann Arbor. I really love my townhouse, but it is unfortunately quite old. All other places around have at least linoleum in the living room, but here we still have carpet everywhere (not healthy). The major issues are doors and windows which need to be replaced (not sealed, recurrence of bugs entering). The bathtubs would also benefit to be replaced with a more modern shower, or at least with new faucets. The air condition is not very efficient upstairs. But I appreciate a lot that I could have my own appliances. The highway is conveniently close by, but not too noisy so that I can enjoy sleeping with opened windows at night. We can walk and bike all around, garden and enjoy wild life ! Help me find US private mints to complete my collection **Last updated on Monday, December 16, 2013**
I am now populating a Google Spreadsheet with this data. You can help! If you don't see your mint below, add it here:  
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1o5eE5ViN_oQd8Igw92C1i3X_GIvGNmR-kAKjI5cd2Yo/viewform

With this spreadsheet, I can feed it into a Python script that will automatically generate the table below. The script is finished! The table you see below was made from the spreadsheet results.

I am now on the mission to collect at least one 1 troy ounce bar from every state in the US in which that company minted the bar. However, there's a huge amount of research I need to go through to accomplish this task. Additionally, there are companies that no longer exist, but their silver is still in circulation.

Do you know of any private mints in your home state? If so, let me know about them! Do you own any bars by some private mint that is either their flagship product, or (in the case of major art mints) has only their name stamped on the bar with not much else in regards to a design? Leave a photo in the comments, please! I'd love to see it.

Anyway, here's my work so far. If you could assist me in completing this table, I would be eternally grateful.

Woodview Commons,"I moved in this March, and after almost 8 months, I can confidently say this has been one of the most lovely and peaceful living experiences I’ve had.

You can immerse yourself in nature, listening to birds chirping and frogs croaking. It’s incredibly quiet and relaxing, perfect for unwinding after a long day. The pool was a highlight during the summer—clean, calm, and just fantastic. The pickleball courts are well maintained, and the gym is top quality.

But what truly sets this place apart is the amazing staff.
Abbey, Lauren, and Matt are always kind, professional, and truly helpful. They respond quickly, treat residents with warmth, and make this place feel like home.

They also host wonderful monthly events that bring the community together. Thanks to these events, I’ve met friendly and diverse neighbors, made new friends, and felt a real sense of belonging.

I honestly feel so lucky to live here. It’s not just an apartment—it’s a vibrant and welcoming community.

hey ann arbor folks, figured i'd share some parking tips for the chirp, velvet snakes, and mycota show at the blind pig on 11/28. parking downtown can be a serious pain in the butt, especially on a friday evening, but we've actually got a huge cheat code for this date.  
  
first though, if you want the absolute easiest way to go, check out prked. it's an app where people rent out their private driveways and garage spots, and honestly, you can often find a spot right next to the venue for way cheaper than the garages. it lets you skip the worst of the circling traffic and it's a super short walk.  
  
now for the cheat code: friday, november 28 is the day after thanksgiving, and the city of ann arbor observes it as an official holiday. this is amazing news for parking because city rules say all public parking meters are free on official city holidays. normally, you'd only get free street parking after 6:00 pm, but on 11/28 you should be fine all day long. look for those metered street spots nearby on first street or washington street, just make absolutely sure you are paying attention to any special signage like a no-parking sign or the dreaded orange tow zone tarp, which the cops are known to use to block off spots.  
  
if the street spots are full (which they will be, everyone knows about the free parking), your best bet is the structure right across the street: the first and washington structure (215 w. washington st.). it’s literally 215 feet away. other solid, super close options are the south ashley lot (lot 88) or the ann ashley parking garage. because it's a city holiday, these structures are also usually free, but they fill up fast, so check the rates on the sign just in case they have a sneaky event rate posted.  
  
timing is key. even with the free parking, downtown traffic, especially around the i-94 and m-23 interchanges, still gets heavy during the friday commuter rush hour until about 5:30 pm. since the show is at 7:00 pm, try to roll in a bit earlier, maybe around 6:00 pm, to snag a spot, even though you won't have to worry about the meter expiring. also, keep your navigation like waze open as you get closer to check for unexpected construction or closures that can cause detours, which are common downtown.  
  
worst case, you can sometimes find pre-paid parking passes online on sites like seatgeek before the show to guarantee a spot in a nearby lot.  
  
hope this helps you save a few bucks and stress less so you can enjoy the music! (Note: I will update this post after 6 months to see if my opinion changes~)

First of all: It’s the best move-in experience I’ve ever had. Everything (bathroom, kitchen, refrigerator, internet, laundry) was ready to use by the day of move-in - even though this is a brand-new apartment. It might sound absurd to say, but I honestly didn’t expect everything to work perfectly since the building had just been completed two weeks before we moved in. But everything really did work fine, and the Woodview team even had the apartment cleaned again the day before we arrived. I couldn’t find a single speck of dust anywhere.

Staff: We’ve had great communication with Lauren, who is extremely helpful with our moving process and generally replies to emails very quickly (usually within a day, except weekends). Abbey also helped us during move-in and was extremely helpful in resolving a WIFI issue. We once submitted a service request about adjusting the shower temperature, and the maintenance team responded within a day. Overall, the Woodview team seems to maintain a strong culture of communication, which I rarely see elsewhere. I hope this continues as more people move in.

Now, some of the good sides and some practical limitations that I have noticed~

Room type: Apartment 2B2B + a den
1.	The apartment itself is beautiful. Our unit faces the pond, so the view is gorgeous, and there’s a small trail outside leading to the clubhouse. At night it’s generally very quiet, with only the sound of crickets.

2.	Many of the built-in finishes are nice: granite surfaces in areas with water, which shows care and suggests they’re aiming for long-term residents. The kitchen is also very nice and spacious.

Amenities:
There’s a pickleball court, pool, spa, gym, etc. There’s also an app to book the court in advance, which is very convenient. Since people are still moving in, the amenities are currently quite empty. I’ll update this in 6 months to see how it develops.

Practical limitations:
1.	Location: It’s not very close to downtown Ann Arbor. It usually takes ~20 minutes to drive to U-M, sometimes ~30 minutes with traffic. Nearby stores are limited (mainly a Meijer). Most plazas take at least ~15 minutes to reach.

2.	Noise from upstairs: As another review mentioned, we can hear footsteps from the floor above. It doesn’t bother us much, but it may matter for others. Since it’s move-in season, I assume t

2.	Noise from upstairs: As another review mentioned, we can hear footsteps from the floor above. It doesn’t bother us much, but it may matter for others. Since it’s move-in season, I assume the noise from people moving furniture around is more obvious than other seasons.

3.	Smell: Being a new building, unable there was a paint-like smell when we moved in. It faded over time and was unnoticeable after about a week.

4.	Package delivery: The delivery system is still a bit inconsistent. I set my address to my apartment, but sometimes packages end up in the leasing office locker and sometimes at my door. The current pattern seems to be small packages → leasing office locker, large packages → door delivery. Hopefully this will become more standardized over time.

Overall: I would rate this 4.5 out of 5 for my ~2 weeks here so far. Most of the current issues seem like things that will improve over time, and I trust the team. Haven’t experienced winter yet, so we’ll see! Parking for Zach Bryan at Michigan Stadium (Ann Arbor 09/27)   
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the zach bryan show at the big house. getting in and out of there for a huge event can be a nightmare if you don't have a plan. traffic is going to be insane, probably even worse than a football game.  
  
honestly the best move is using an app like prked. you can rent a local's driveway or garage right next to michigan stadium. it's usually way cheaper than the huge lots, you get a guaranteed spot, and you can park in a neighborhood that lets you skip a lot of the post-show traffic chaos. it's a short walk and just so much easier.  
  
if you don't do that, here are the other options.  
  
the official university lots close to the stadium are mostly for permit holders, so getting a spot can be tough. if you can buy a pass in advance online, do it.  
  
the biggest and most popular lots are the ann arbor golf and outing club and pioneer high school, which is right across the street. these are huge and a solid option but they will fill up hours before the show, so you have to get there super early. expect to pay a decent amount for these.  
  
you can also try parking in one of the downtown ann arbor garages. they are cheaper but it's a bit of a walk, maybe 20-30 minutes to the stadium. some might have shuttles but walking is pretty common.  
  
i would not try to find street parking. the city has on-street parking restrictions for stadium events from 8 a.m. until midnight on the day of the concert and they do tow cars. it's just not worth the risk.  
  
a few other things to know – they close a bunch of roads around the stadium several hours before the event, including parts of main street and stadium blvd. after the show, main street will be one-way heading south to get people to I-94, so plan your route out accordingly. if you're taking an uber or lyft, they'll have to drop you off a few blocks away and you'll have to walk in. getting one after the show is really tough, you’ll have to walk a good distance away from the stadium to find a spot where they can even get to you.  
  
no matter what you do, get there early, be patient, and have a plan.  
  
hope this helps, it's going to be an awesome show We love our green space at Woodview Commons. Lauren and  Abby super friendly and really care about this complex and its renters!  They encourage meeting others by hosting an event per month! Is mid-year report required for University of Michigan Ann Arbor? Hello! I applied regular decision for Umich.
